\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{tructural} Health Monitoring (SHM) is a pivotal engineering tool, providing real-time structural integrity data,
thereby ensuring safety and averting infrastructure failures \cite{gharehbaghi_critical_2022} \cite{katam_review_2023}.
Traditional SHM methods, while effective, are often limited by factors such as
high cost, complexity, and accessibility issues \cite{katam_review_2023} \cite{gharehbaghi_critical_2022}.
A portable, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) device presents a promising solution for efficient and accessible SHM,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods \cite{guo_portable_2022} \cite{chen_research_2023}.
The objective of this capstone project is to explore the potential of a portable,
NDT device in overcoming the limitations of traditional SHM methods.

SHM is a field dedicated to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the structural integrity
of various infrastructure systems \cite{katam_review_2023}, NDT is a method that enables the assessment
of structural degradation without causing actual damage to the structure itself \cite{katam_review_2023},
and a portable NDT device is a tool that enhances the efficiency and accessibility of SHM \cite{hassani_systematic_2023} \cite{katam_review_2023}.
Various NDT methods, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages,
offer diverse approaches to assessing structural integrity without causing damage \cite{khedmatgozar_dolati_non-destructive_2021}.
Existing portable NDT devices, while offering promising functionalities,
also present certain limitations that need to be addressed for optimal SHM \cite{hassani_systematic_2023}.
Relevant theories and frameworks related to structural safety, damage detection,
and sensor technology play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of SHM
and ensuring the safety of various infrastructures \cite{chen_sensor_2021} \cite{gharehbaghi_critical_2022}.


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Extraction and Evaluation of Research Data}
For our research, scholarly articles were extracted from the \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}{ScienceDirect (Elsevier)} platform.
This database offers comprehensive coverage of various scientific publications,
especially those that correlate with the field of structural engineering and NDT,
which are integral to our study.

To proceed, two sets of keywords were carefully curated to narrow the search and ensure that
results focused specifically on the various aspects of our research topic. The exact keyword
settts were then used as criteria for filtering and searching articles in \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}{ScienceDirect}:

\begin{enumerate}[label={Keyword Set \arabic*:}, leftmargin=*]
  \item NDT, Non-destructive testing, Portable NDT, Handheld NDT, Portable inspection device, Portable sensing device.
  \item SHM, Structural health monitoring, Structural integrity, Safety assessment, Condition monitoring.
\end{enumerate}

The total number of articles retrieved from the keyword search were 1169 titles.
However,to refine the search results further we applied exclusion and inclusion criteria.
The following criteria are;
(1) We limited the publication timeframe to the years 2019-2024 to ensure that the retrieved
articles reflect recent advancements and developments in the field.
This custom date range allowed us to access the most up-to-date research findings and methodologies relevant to our study;
(2) We only considered articles falling within the subject area of engineering to
ensure alignment with the interdisciplinary nature of our research topic.
By focusing on engineering-related publications, we aimed to draw from a diverse range of
studies and methodologies that contribute to the advancement of structural safety and non-destructive testing techniques;
(3) Only research publications were taken into consideration for inclusion since they offer thorough analyses and factual
data that are crucial for guiding our analysis and research technique.
The prioritization of articles from reputable engineering publications, such as Construction and Building Materials,
NDT \& E International, Structures, and Ultrasonics, was based on their relevance to our study aims and their
significance in the area.

Subsequent application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the exclusion of 587 articles based on year published,
titles, and abstract screening. Manual research gap analysis and text evaluation further refined the selection,
leading to the exclusion of an additional 223 articles. Among the remaining articles, 165 underwent full-text evaluation,
and 135 were excluded based on subject relevance and alignment with study objectives.

The application of our methodological approach resulted in the inclusion of 30 studies that met the predefined
criteria and were deemed suitable for further analysis and synthesis in our research on developing a portable
NDT device for efficient structural health monitoring as shown in \autoref{fig:flowchartFilter}.

in structural components.
Studies \cite{ziaja_shm_2021} \cite{sanchez-romate_structural_2021} \cite{tang_explainable_2023} have demonstrated the utility of optical techniques such as
digital image correlation (DIC) and fiber optic sensing in capturing fine-scale deformations and detecting surface defects.
However, limitations persist in optical sensor deployment, especially in harsh environmental conditions and dynamic loading
scenarios. 

\subsection{Acoustic Emission Testing (AET) for Structural Integrity Assessment}
Acoustic Emission Testing (AET) is a valuable technique for assessing structural integrity and detecting active defects
in civil engineering structures. By monitoring transient stress waves emitted during deformation, AET systems provide
insights into the onset and progression of damage mechanisms
\cite{katunin_modeling_2021} \cite{zhang_spatial_2023} \cite{li_physics-informed_2023}. Research indicates the potential of AET
in localizing defects, characterizing material properties, and assessing the structural health of critical infrastructure
components. However, challenges remain in distinguishing relevant signals from background noise and interpreting complex
waveforms accurately.

\subsection{Vibration Analysis for Modal Analysis and Fatigue Assessment}
Vibration analysis techniques are widely employed for modal analysis and fatigue assessment of civil engineering structures.
By studying the dynamic response of structures to external forces, vibration-based methods offer valuable insights into structural
behavior and performance \cite{carcione_demodulation_2020} \cite{de_sa_rodrigues_probability_2023} \cite{zhang_defect_2020}. Studies have utilized vibration sensors and accelerometers to identify natural
frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes, aiding in structural health monitoring and damage detection efforts.
However, challenges persist in distinguishing between environmental vibrations and structural responses,
particularly in noisy operational environments. 

\subsection{Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for Subsurface Imaging and Material Characterization}
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a non-invasive geophysical method used for subsurface imaging and
material characterization in civil engineering applications. By emitting electromagnetic pulses into the
ground and analyzing reflected signals, GPR systems provide insights into subsurface features, voids,
and material properties \cite{balasubramaniam_multi_2022} \cite{tang_explainable_2023} \cite{katunin_identification_2021}.
Research highlights the effectiveness of GPR in detecting buried utilities,
assessing pavement condition, and evaluating concrete structures for voids and delaminations. However,
challenges remain in interpreting GPR data accurately, especially in complex geological settings and heterogeneous materials.

\subsection{Ultrasonic Testing (UT) for Thickness Measurement and Flaw Detection}
Ultrasonic Testing (UT) is a widely used non-destructive testing technique for thickness measurement
and flaw detection in civil engineering materials. By transmitting high-frequency sound waves into the
material and analyzing their reflections, UT systems enable precise evaluation of internal defects,
corrosion, and thickness variations \cite{lambinet_measurement_2022} \cite{zhang_spatial_2023} \cite{li_physics-informed_2023}.
Studies have demonstrated the versatility of UT
in assessing the integrity of steel structures, concrete elements, and composite materials.
However, challenges persist in calibrating UT instruments, interpreting echo signals, and ensuring inspection coverage
in complex geometries. 

\subsection{Thermography for Heat Signature Analysis and Delamination Detection}
Thermography techniques offer non-contact and rapid inspection capabilities for heat
signature analysis and delamination detection in civil engineering structures.
By detecting temperature differentials and thermal anomalies, thermographic systems provide valuable
insights into subsurface defects, moisture intrusion, and material degradation
\cite{rehman_advancing_2024} \cite{parida_comparative_2023} \cite{wu_internal_2024}.
Research indicates the potential of thermography in identifying hidden defects, detecting water ingress,
and evaluating structural performance under varying environmental conditions.
However, challenges remain in standardizing thermographic procedures, mitigating environmental influences,
and interpreting thermal data accurately.
