\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{tructural} Health Monitoring (SHM) is a pivotal engineering tool, providing real-time structural integrity data,
thereby ensuring safety and averting infrastructure failures \cite{Gharehbaghi2022} \cite{Katam2023}.
Traditional SHM methods, while effective, are often limited by factors such as
high cost, complexity, and accessibility issues \cite{Katam2023} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.
A portable, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) device presents a promising solution for efficient and accessible SHM,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods \cite{Guo2022} \cite{Chen2023}.
The objective of this capstone project is to explore the potential of a portable,
NDT device in overcoming the limitations of traditional SHM methods.

SHM is a field dedicated to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the structural integrity
of various infrastructure systems \cite{Katam2023}, NDT is a method that enables the assessment
of structural degradation without causing actual damage to the structure itself \cite{Katam2023},
and a portable NDT device is a tool that enhances the efficiency and accessibility of SHM \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Katam2023}.
Various NDT methods, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages,
offer diverse approaches to assessing structural integrity without causing damage \cite{Dolati2021} \cite{Verma2013}.
Existing portable NDT devices, while offering promising functionalities,
also present certain limitations that need to be addressed for optimal SHM \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Zhu2011}.
Relevant theories and frameworks related to structural safety, damage detection,
and sensor technology play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of SHM
and ensuring the safety of various infrastructures \cite{Chen2021} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.
