\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{tructural} Health Monitoring (SHM) is a pivotal engineering tool, providing real-time structural integrity data,
thereby ensuring safety and averting infrastructure failures \cite{Gharehbaghi2022} \cite{Katam2023}.
Traditional SHM methods, while effective, are often limited by factors such as
high cost, complexity, and accessibility issues \cite{Katam2023} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.
A portable, non-destructive testing (NDT) device presents a promising solution for efficient and accessible SHM,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods \cite{Guo2022} \cite{Chen2023}.
The objective of this capstone project is to explore the potential of a portable,
non-destructive testing (NDT) device in overcoming the limitations of traditional Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods.


\section{Background}
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a field dedicated to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the structural integrity
of various infrastructure systems \cite{Katam2023}, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) is a method that enables the assessment
of structural degradation without causing actual damage to the structure itself \cite{Katam2023},
and a portable NDT device is a tool that enhances the efficiency and accessibility of SHM \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Katam2023}.
Various Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages,
offer diverse approaches to assessing structural integrity without causing damage \cite{Dolati2021} \cite{Verma2013}.
Existing portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) devices, while offering promising functionalities,
also present certain limitations that need to be addressed for optimal Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Zhu2011}.
Relevant theories and frameworks related to structural safety, damage detection,
and sensor technology play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)
and ensuring the safety of various infrastructures \cite{Chen2021} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.


\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Existing Portable NDT Devices}
Recent research and development efforts have led to significant advancements in portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) devices
for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications \cite{Vijayan2023} \cite{Parsy2018} \cite{Hassani2023}.
Various devices, each with their unique functionalities, target applications, and performance characteristics,
have been analyzed to understand their potential in different fields \cite{Khanna2020} \cite{Baig2021} \cite{Corzo2020}.
Existing research has identified several limitations and challenges, such as sample characteristic limitations,
methodological limitations, psychometric limitations, and qualitative research limitations.


\subsection{Sensor Technology for SHM}
Recent advancements in sensor technology, such as miniaturization, low-power consumption, and wireless communication,
have significantly enhanced the capabilities of portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) devices,
making them more efficient and accessible for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Valeske2020}.
The integration of different sensor types and their data fusion approaches is crucial
for comprehensive Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), as it allows for a more accurate\
and holistic assessment of structural integrity \cite{Broer2022} \cite{Azimi2020}.
Sensor technology limitations, such as accuracy, precision, and robustness,
can significantly impact the performance and reliability of devices,
necessitating further research and development in this area \cite{Varshney2021} \cite{Moore2020}.


\subsection{Data Acquisition and Analysis for SHM}
Methods for data acquisition, processing, and analysis from portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
devices have seen significant advancements, with research highlighting the use of optical
and electrochemical methods for in situ detection of trace heavy metal ions \cite{Hu2023}.
Approaches for real-time data monitoring, damage detection algorithms, and data visualization techniques
are integral to the effective application of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), with advancements in these areas
significantly enhancing the capabilities of portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) devices \cite{Azimi2020} \cite{Lingxin2022}.
Efficient Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) decision-making is often challenged by issues related
to data management and interpretation, such as the complexity of handling big data and the time-consuming procedures
for feature extraction and statistical decision-making \cite{Entezami2020}.


\subsection{Applications and Case Studies}
Portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) devices have been successfully applied in various Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)
scenarios, including bridges, buildings, and industrial structures, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness \cite{Parsy2018} \cite{Azimi2020}.
The cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and reliability of portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
devices in real-world settings have been demonstrated, with the modularized structure of the device offering
cost-effectiveness through the reusability of high-cost modules and enhancing convenience by eliminating the
necessity for multiple separate monitoring devices \cite{Lee2023}.
Emerging trends in portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technology for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)
include the integration of intelligent technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and advancements in sensor technologies, which have led to remarkable improvements in SHM for various applications
including residential, commercial, industrial, historical, and special buildings \cite{Vijayan2023} \cite{Hassani2023}. 


\section{Synthesis and Critique}
The literature review reveals significant advancements in sensor technologies and data analytics
for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM),
while also highlighting limitations and research gaps that need to be addressed for optimal infrastructure safety \cite{Vijayan2023} \cite{Hassani2023}.
Existing portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) devices have shown effectiveness in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM),
however, their performance can be influenced by factors such as sensor accuracy, data processing capabilities,
and environmental conditions \cite{Vijayan2023} \cite{Hassani2023}.
Opportunities for improvement and future development in portable Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) devices
for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) lie in the integration of advanced technologies such as embedded systems,
wireless sensors, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence for improved analytics, error-free inference,
and efficient troubleshooting \cite{Meier2018}.
