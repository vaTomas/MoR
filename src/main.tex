\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{tructural} Health Monitoring (SHM) is a pivotal engineering tool, providing real-time structural integrity data,
thereby ensuring safety and averting infrastructure failures \cite{gharehbaghi_critical_2022} \cite{katam_review_2023}.
Traditional SHM methods, while effective, are often limited by factors such as
high cost, complexity, and accessibility issues \cite{katam_review_2023} \cite{gharehbaghi_critical_2022}.
A portable, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) device presents a promising solution for efficient and accessible SHM,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods \cite{guo_portable_2022} \cite{chen_research_2023}.
The objective of this capstone project is to explore the potential of a portable,
NDT device in overcoming the limitations of traditional SHM methods.

SHM is a field dedicated to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the structural integrity
of various infrastructure systems \cite{katam_review_2023}, NDT is a method that enables the assessment
of structural degradation without causing actual damage to the structure itself \cite{katam_review_2023},
and a portable NDT device is a tool that enhances the efficiency and accessibility of SHM \cite{hassani_systematic_2023} \cite{katam_review_2023}.
Various NDT methods, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages,
offer diverse approaches to assessing structural integrity without causing damage \cite{khedmatgozar_dolati_non-destructive_2021}.
Existing portable NDT devices, while offering promising functionalities,
also present certain limitations that need to be addressed for optimal SHM \cite{hassani_systematic_2023}.
Relevant theories and frameworks related to structural safety, damage detection,
and sensor technology play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of SHM
and ensuring the safety of various infrastructures \cite{chen_sensor_2021} \cite{gharehbaghi_critical_2022}.


\section{Methodology}
This study employed both scientometric review and systematic review methodologies to identify the research gap in
Developing a Portable NDT Device for Efficient Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) construction.
The schematic representation of our methodology is illustrated in \autoref{fig:flowchartMethod}.

\subsection{Extraction and Evaluation of Research Data}
For our research, bibliometric data were extracted from \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}{ScienceDirect (Elsevier)} platform,
renowned for its extensive coverage of scientific publications especially those that correlate with the field of our study.

To proceed, two sets of keywords specifically Non-Destructive Testing and Structural Health Monitoring were carefully selected
to narrow down the search and only yield articles directly relevant to our study. 
The search yielded a substantial pool of one thousand one hundred sixty-nine (1,169) article titles.
However, to ensure the precision and relevance of our findings, we employed a meticulous process of refinement through the
application of exclusion and inclusion criteria.

First, we stragetically limited the publication timeframe from the years 2019 to 2023.
This allowed us to capture recent advancements and developments in our field of inquiry,
providing access to the most up-to-date research findings and methodologies.
The exclusion of the year 2024 was necessary as it had only just commenced, ensuring a focus on established research outcomes.

Secondly, we only considered articles falling within the subject area of engineering to ensure alignment with the
interdisciplinary nature of our research topic. By focusing on engineering-related publications, we aimed to draw
from a diverse range of studies and methodologies that contribute to the advancement of structural safety and non-destructive
testing techniques.

Furthermore, we adopted a selective approach in considering publications for inclusion, prioritizing research articles over
other forms of literature. The prioritization of articles from reputable engineering publications, such as Construction and
Building Materials, NDT \& E International, Structures, and Ultrasonics, was based on their relevance to our study aims and
their significance in the area.

Subsequent application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the exclusion of
five hundred eighty-seven (587) articles based on year published, titles, and abstract screening.
Manual research gap analysis and text evaluation further refined the selection, leading to the exclusion of an
additional two hundred twenty-three (228) articles.
Among the remaining articles, one hundred sixty-five (165) underwent full-text evaluation,
and one hundred thirty-five (135) were excluded based on subject relevance and alignment with study objectives.

The application of our  methodological approach resulted in the inclusion of
thirty (30) studies that met the predefined criteria and were deemed suitable for further analysis and synthesis in our
research on developing a portable NDT device for efficient structural health monitoring as shown in \autoref{fig:flowchartFilter}.

\subsection{Keyword Analysis}
This section delineates the co-occurrence network of keywords generated by VOSviewer,
which illustrates the interconnections between keywords within our research domain.
With fifteen (15) occurrences, "structural health monitoring" emerges as the most prominent keyword, followed by
"nondestructive testing" with seven (7) occurrences. This analysis sheds light on the thematic landscape of our research,
revealing key focal points and areas of emphasis as shown in \autoref{fig:coOccuranceNetwork}.
For instance, the frequency of phrases such as
"guided waves" and "ultrasound" highlights the importance of sophisticated sensing techniques in structural
health monitoring. Moreover, the occurrence of keywords such as "damage detection" and "damage localization"
emphasizes the overall purpose of identifying and mitigating structural vulnerabilities.

\section{Discussion and Future Directions} 
The analysis of existing literature on structural health monitoring (SHM) and non-destructive testing (NDT) revealed significant progress and ongoing challenges in the field. Among the key themes explored were the integration of intelligent technologies \cite{yang_broadband_2023}\cite{ziaja_shm_2021}\cite{bevan_automated_2022}, advancements in sensor networks, data analytics \cite{de_sa_rodrigues_probability_2023}, \cite{li_physics-informed_2023}, \cite{tabjula_sparse_2023}, and the need for portable and cost-effective sensing technologies. Standardization and validation efforts are also highlighted as critical for ensuring the reliability and comparability of results across studies. Interestingly, despite the breadth of research in the field, there was a notable gap: the absence of a lightweight, cost-effective portable and non-destructive testing (NDT) device that can be widely utilized by both professionals and non-professionals for structural health monitoring. While existing technologies cater to specialized industries or require extensive expertise to operate, there is a clear need for a device that is accessible to anyone in need of structural health monitoring, especially households and small businesses \cite{ziaja_shm_2021}, \cite{zhang_defect_2020}-\cite{yifei_structure_2023}, \cite{tabjula_sparse_2023} .
 
Our research project directly aims to address this gap by focusing on the development of a device that is profficient in its capabilities while serving in a lightweight, cost-effective, and user-friendly  profile. By prioritizing accessibility and ease of use, we aim to better structural health monitoring, making it accessible to a broader audience beyond traditional engineering and construction professionals.  Aligned with broader goals, by making it accessible, we contribute to its democratization standardization.

Moving forward, our research project will continue to focus on refining and optimizing the portable a non-destructive testing (NDT) device, incorporating feedback from field trials and real-world applications. Simultaneously, envisioning the device as a medium to empower individuals and communities to proactively monitor the health and integrity of their structures, ultimately enhancing safety, reliability, and resilience at all levels of society.
