\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{tructural} Health Monitoring (SHM) is a pivotal engineering tool, providing real-time structural integrity data,
thereby ensuring safety and averting infrastructure failures \cite{Gharehbaghi2022} \cite{Katam2023}.
Traditional SHM methods, while effective, are often limited by factors such as
high cost, complexity, and accessibility issues \cite{Katam2023} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.
A portable, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) device presents a promising solution for efficient and accessible SHM,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods \cite{Guo2022} \cite{Chen2023}.
The objective of this capstone project is to explore the potential of a portable,
NDT device in overcoming the limitations of traditional SHM methods.

SHM is a field dedicated to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the structural integrity
of various infrastructure systems \cite{Katam2023}, NDT is a method that enables the assessment
of structural degradation without causing actual damage to the structure itself \cite{Katam2023},
and a portable NDT device is a tool that enhances the efficiency and accessibility of SHM \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Katam2023}.
Various NDT methods, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages,
offer diverse approaches to assessing structural integrity without causing damage \cite{Dolati2021} \cite{Verma2013}.
Existing portable NDT devices, while offering promising functionalities,
also present certain limitations that need to be addressed for optimal SHM \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Zhu2011}.
Relevant theories and frameworks related to structural safety, damage detection,
and sensor technology play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of SHM
and ensuring the safety of various infrastructures \cite{Chen2021} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.

For our research, scholarly articles were extracted from the
\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}{ScienceDirect (Elsevier)} platform.
This database offers comprehensive coverage of various scientific publications,
especially those that correlate with the field of structural engineering and NDT
which are integral to our study.

To proceed, 4 sets of keywords were carefully curated to narrow the search and ensure that results focused
specifically on the various aspects of our research topic. The exact keyword sets were then used as criteria
for filtering and searching articles in ScienceDirect:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item NDT, Non-destructive testing, Portable NDT, Handheld NDT, Portable inspection device, Portable sensing device
  \item SHM, Structural health monitoring, Structural integrity, Safety assessment, Condition monitoring
  \item Ultrasonic, Ultrasonic testing, Concrete inspection, Concrete testing
  \item Miniaturization, Wireless communication, Internet of Things (IoT), Sensor networks, Real-time monitoring
\end{enumerate}

By utilizing these carefully curated keyword sets,
we aimed to ensure that the extracted articles were highly relevant to our research objectives on developing
a portable NDT device for efficient structural health monitoring, particularly focusing on ultrasonic testing
in concrete structures. 

In addition to the keyword sets, we applied exclusion and inclusion criteria to refine the search results further.
Firstly, we limited the publication timeframe to the years 2019-2024 to ensure that the retrieved articles reflect
recent advancements and developments in the field. This custom date range allowed us to access the most up-to-date
research findings and methodologies relevant to our study.

Furthermore, only research publications were taken into consideration for inclusion since they offer thorough
analyses and factual data that are crucial for guiding our analysis and research technique.
The prioritization of articles from reputable engineering publications, such as Construction and Building Materials,
NDT and E International, Structures, and Ultrasonics, was based on their relevance to our study aims
and their significance in the area.

Lastly, articles falling within the subject area of engineering were selected to ensure alignment
with the interdisciplinary nature of our research topic. By focusing on engineering-related publications,
we aimed to draw from a diverse range of studies and methodologies that contribute to the advancement
of structural safety and non-destructive testing techniques.

The total number of articles retrieved from the keyword search were 263 titles.
Subsequent application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the exclusion of
77 articles based on year published, titles, and abstract screening. Manual research gap analysis
and text evaluation further refined the selection, leading to the exclusion of an additional 48 articles.
Among the remaining articles, 138 were focused on engineering, indicating their relevance to our research topic.
However, after thorough evaluation, 109 articles were excluded based on subject relevance and alignment with our study objectives.

In summary, the application of our  methodological approach resulted in the inclusion of
29 studies that met the predefined criteria and were deemed suitable for further analysis and
synthesis in our research on developing a portable NDT device for efficient structural health monitoring.
