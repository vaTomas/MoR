\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{S}{tructural} Health Monitoring (SHM) is a pivotal engineering tool, providing real-time structural integrity data,
thereby ensuring safety and averting infrastructure failures \cite{Gharehbaghi2022} \cite{Katam2023}.
Traditional SHM methods, while effective, are often limited by factors such as
high cost, complexity, and accessibility issues \cite{Katam2023} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.
A portable, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) device presents a promising solution for efficient and accessible SHM,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods \cite{Guo2022} \cite{Chen2023}.
The objective of this capstone project is to explore the potential of a portable,
NDT device in overcoming the limitations of traditional SHM methods.

SHM is a field dedicated to the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the structural integrity
of various infrastructure systems \cite{Katam2023}, NDT is a method that enables the assessment
of structural degradation without causing actual damage to the structure itself \cite{Katam2023},
and a portable NDT device is a tool that enhances the efficiency and accessibility of SHM \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Katam2023}.
Various NDT methods, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages,
offer diverse approaches to assessing structural integrity without causing damage \cite{Dolati2021} \cite{Verma2013}.
Existing portable NDT devices, while offering promising functionalities,
also present certain limitations that need to be addressed for optimal SHM \cite{Hassani2023} \cite{Zhu2011}.
Relevant theories and frameworks related to structural safety, damage detection,
and sensor technology play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of SHM
and ensuring the safety of various infrastructures \cite{Chen2021} \cite{Gharehbaghi2022}.


\section{Methodology}
This study employed both scientometric review and systematic review methodologies to identify the research
gap in Developing a Portable NDT Device for SHM in construction.
The schematic representation of our methodology is illustrated in \autoref{fig:flowchartMethod}.

\subsection{Extraction and Evaluation of Research Data}
For our research, scholarly articles were extracted from the \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}{ScienceDirect (Elsevier)} platform.
This database offers comprehensive coverage of various scientific publications,
especially those that correlate with the field of structural engineering and NDT,
which are integral to our study.

To proceed, two sets of keywords were carefully curated to narrow the search and ensure that
results focused specifically on the various aspects of our research topic. The exact keyword
settts were then used as criteria for filtering and searching articles in \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}{ScienceDirect}:

\begin{enumerate}[label={Keyword Set \arabic*:}, leftmargin=*]
  \item NDT, Non-destructive testing, Portable NDT, Handheld NDT, Portable inspection device, Portable sensing device.
  \item SHM, Structural health monitoring, Structural integrity, Safety assessment, Condition monitoring.
\end{enumerate}

The total number of articles retrieved from the keyword search were 1169 titles.
However,to refine the search results further we applied exclusion and inclusion criteria.
The following criteria are;
(1) We limited the publication timeframe to the years 2019-2024 to ensure that the retrieved
articles reflect recent advancements and developments in the field.
This custom date range allowed us to access the most up-to-date research findings and methodologies relevant to our study;
(2) We only considered articles falling within the subject area of engineering to
ensure alignment with the interdisciplinary nature of our research topic.
By focusing on engineering-related publications, we aimed to draw from a diverse range of
studies and methodologies that contribute to the advancement of structural safety and non-destructive testing techniques;
(3) Only research publications were taken into consideration for inclusion since they offer thorough analyses and factual
data that are crucial for guiding our analysis and research technique.
The prioritization of articles from reputable engineering publications, such as Construction and Building Materials,
NDT \& E International, Structures, and Ultrasonics, was based on their relevance to our study aims and their
significance in the area.

Subsequent application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the exclusion of 587 articles based on year published,
titles, and abstract screening. Manual research gap analysis and text evaluation further refined the selection,
leading to the exclusion of an additional 223 articles. Among the remaining articles, 165 underwent full-text evaluation,
and 135 were excluded based on subject relevance and alignment with study objectives.

The application of our methodological approach resulted in the inclusion of 30 studies that met the predefined
criteria and were deemed suitable for further analysis and synthesis in our research on developing a portable
NDT device for efficient structural health monitoring as shown in \autoref{fig:flowchartFilter}.

devices have seen significant advancements, with research highlighting the use of optical
and electrochemical methods for in situ detection of trace heavy metal ions \cite{Hu2023}.
Approaches for real-time data monitoring, damage detection algorithms, and data visualization techniques
are integral to the effective application of SHM, with advancements in these areas
significantly enhancing the capabilities of portable NDT devices \cite{Azimi2020} \cite{Lingxin2022}.
Efficient SHM decision-making is often challenged by issues related
to data management and interpretation, such as the complexity of handling big data and the time-consuming procedures
for feature extraction and statistical decision-making \cite{Entezami2020}.


\subsection{Applications and Case Studies}
Portable NDT devices have been successfully applied in various SHM
scenarios, including bridges, buildings, and industrial structures, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness \cite{Parsy2018} \cite{Azimi2020}.
The cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and reliability of portable NDT
devices in real-world settings have been demonstrated, with the modularized structure of the device offering
cost-effectiveness through the reusability of high-cost modules and enhancing convenience by eliminating the
necessity for multiple separate monitoring devices \cite{Lee2023}.
Emerging trends in portable NDT technology for SHM
include the integration of intelligent technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and advancements in sensor technologies, which have led to remarkable improvements in SHM for various applications
including residential, commercial, industrial, historical, and special buildings \cite{Vijayan2023} \cite{Hassani2023}. 


\subsection{Synthesis and Critique}
The literature review reveals significant advancements in sensor technologies and data analytics
for NDT and SHM,
while also highlighting limitations and research gaps that need to be addressed for optimal infrastructure safety \cite{Vijayan2023} \cite{Hassani2023}.
Existing portable NDT devices have shown effectiveness in SHM,
however, their performance can be influenced by factors such as sensor accuracy, data processing capabilities,
and environmental conditions \cite{Vijayan2023} \cite{Hassani2023}.
Opportunities for improvement and future development in portable NDT devices
for SHM lie in the integration of advanced technologies such as embedded systems,
wireless sensors, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence for improved analytics, error-free inference,
and efficient troubleshooting \cite{Meier2018}.
