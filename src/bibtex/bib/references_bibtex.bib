	abstract = {DDigital products and services are disrupting traditional industries, now, everywhere. The latest generation of smartphones, tablets and wearables play a key role in advancing technological avenues, in providing higher flexibility, and in improving productivity levels. Opportunities arising from the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are getting understood and embraced by virtually all industries today, and by more and more companies. These opportunities are also finding their way into the manual ultrasonic Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) market. Frequently found roadblocks to the uptake of such powerful and versatile digital platforms in NDT are found to be • regulations, e.g. usage of wireless data transmission in oil \& gas (O\&G), • restrictive company rules, e.g. companies blocking smartphones or cameras, • long standing and user habits, e.g. maintaining inefficient outdated workflows, • fear of external data storage, e.g. blocking cloud-based backup solutions. To overcome these and expedite the digital transformation in the NDT markets, NDT supplier companies need to take the efforts to illustrate the huge number of advantages that the combination of NDT and digitalization yield. On examples from various industries, inefficiencies in ultrasonic NDT workflows will be identified, and faster, more flexible, lower cost, and higher quality testing solutions will be suggested. The authors will illustrate how users have achieved tremendous benefits from using IoT-based solutions. Based on these case studies, the attractiveness of the business case for investments in digital infrastructure and IoT in NDT applications will be clearly shown, and evidence of savings by using novel solutions will be provided.},

	abstract = {Wireless connectivity to test probes and sensors is entering the Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) sector. 
Processing of data in many industries already relies on Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). And, at the same
time, cloud-based data storage has been surrounding the NDT field, as virtually every NDT user also
employs cloud storage for production data, processing tools, and reporting. Despite hurdles such as oil
\& gas regulations and restrictive guidelines and habits with respect to workflows and data storage, the
Industry 4.0 revolution is omnipresent. The opportunities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data
are understood and adopted by virtually all industries and more and more companies today. In this
paper, we identify major inefficiencies in NDT workflows today. On examples from various industries,
we illustrate how productivity levels can be increased, money saved and overall inspection speed
multiplied. Capabilities of A.I. in test data interpretation, combination of data, immediate reporting, and
real-time sharing are demonstrated. With this paper, we propose to initiate a task group of experts to
foster usage of the new Industry 4.0 instruments in NDT and to support users in adapting the internal
workflows and processes to increase the competitiveness of NDT overall.},

The article discusses intelligent technologies in SHM for residential, commercial, industrial, historical, and special buildings, such as nuclear power plants (NPPs). With the incorporation of intelligent technologies, there have been remarkable advancements in SHM, a crucial aspect of infrastructure safety, reliability, and durability.

Data-driven methods based on statistical pattern recognition provide outstanding opportunities to implement a long-term SHM strategy, by exploiting measured vibration data. However, their main limitation, due to big data or high-dimensional features, is linked to the complex and time-consuming procedures for feature extraction and/or statistical decision-making. To cope with this issue, in this article we propose a strategy based on autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling for feature extraction, and on an innovative hybrid divergence-based method for feature classification. Data relevant to a cable-stayed bridge are accounted for to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the offered hybrid divergence-based method, in conjunction with ARMA modeling, succeeds in detecting damage in cases strongly characterized by big data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Heavy metal ions, one of the major pollutants in the environment, exhibit non-degradable and bio-chain accumulation characteristics, seriously damage the environment, and threaten human health. Traditional heavy metal ion detection methods often require complex and expensive instruments, professional operation, tedious sample preparation, high requirements for laboratory conditions, and operator professionalism, and they cannot be widely used in the field for real-time and rapid detection. Therefore, developing portable, highly sensitive, selective, and economical sensors is necessary for the detection of toxic metal ions in the field. This paper presents portable sensing based on optical and electrochemical methods for the in situ detection of trace heavy metal ions. Progress in research on portable sensor devices based on fluorescence, colorimetric, portable surface Raman enhancement, plasmon resonance, and various electrical parameter analysis principles is highlighted, and the characteristics of the detection limits, linear detection ranges, and stability of the various sensing methods are analyzed. Accordingly, this review provides a reference for the design of portable heavy metal ion sensing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Among all civil infrastructures, bridges are one of the most important elements in the transportation system. As such, to prevent any failures caused by aging and environmental impacts, bridges require periodic inspections. This becomes even more critical due to climate change and its effect on bridges, especially in the coastal regions. Most of the inspections conducted incorporate the visual type of evaluation due to its simplicity. However, with the current developments in new technologies, there is a need for more advanced techniques of structural health monitoring (SHM) methods to be incorporated in the maintenance programs for more accurate and efficient surveys. In this paper, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods applicable to steel bridges are reviewed, with a focus on methods applicable to local damage detection. Moreover, the methodology, advantages and disadvantages, and up-to-date research on NDT methods are presented. Furthermore, the application of novel NDT techniques using innovative sensors, drones, and robots for the rapid and efficient assessment of damages on small and large scales is emphasized. This study is deemed necessary as it compiles in one place the available information regarding NDT methods for in-service steel bridges. Access to such information is critical for researchers who intend to work on new or improved NDT techniques.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In a highly competitive and demanding microelectronics market, non-destructive testing (NDT) technology has been widely applied to defect detection and evaluation of microelectronic packaging. However, the trend of microelectronic packaging toward miniaturization, high-density, ultra-thin, ultra-light and with small chip footprint, poses an urgent demand for novel NDT methods with high-resolution and large penetration depth, which is utilized for internal defect detection and identification of advanced complicated packages. The conventional NDT methods for microelectronic packaging mainly include optical visual inspection, X-ray inspection, active infrared thermography, scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser Doppler vibration measuring technique, scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and so on. This paper aims to provide a review of addressing their basic principles, advantages, limitations and application researches in the field of defect inspection of microelectronic packaging.

Due to high-voltage fields and harsh environmental conditions, SRIs eventually deteriorate with use in the power grid, decreasing their insulating performance and operational life and contributing to transmission line failures. Therefore, quantitatively assessing the aging status of SRIs is crucial. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the magnetic resonance method for assessing the age of SRIs at the level of chemical structure; we built and made a portable magnetic resonance sensor, and evaluated the sensor’s functionality. By measuring the SRI sheds at various service times, it was discovered that the equivalent transverse relaxation time, T2eff, can describe the degree of aging of the SRIs. The results of the magnetic resonance measurements were also compared with those of the static contact angle method, and the two measurement methods yielded the same conclusions. However, the magnetic resonance method was more sensitive than the one using the static contact angle method.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As a possible method for structural health monitoring, guided waves are excellent for hidden damage diagnosis due to their long propagation distance and high damage sensitivity. The multimodal and dispersion phenomena are the primary challenges in the use of guided wave technology for engineering applications. Currently, plate, thin-walled tube, and rod structures—where multimodality and dispersion are comparatively mild and simple to control—remain the major applications of guided wave technology. For more complicated civil engineering structures, severe multimodal and dispersion phenomena cause more difficult issues. The present work began with the study of round-faced reinforced concrete. The waveguide propagation characteristics are computationally analyzed with the assistance of theoretical calculation methods and sweeping frequency simulation experiments. These analytical tools are then creatively applied to threaded reinforced concrete, and the dispersion characteristics of this complex, axially periodically varying waveguide are successfully analyzed. The phenomenon of frequency band pass/stop is also discussed. In addition, this research provides ideas for nondestructive testing and inverse imaging in this field by means of deep learning of the interface debonding defect characteristics of reinforced concrete with the help of convolutional neural networks. This work can be applied not only to various complex reinforced concrete structures but can also be extended to waveguide propagation analysis and defect size data inversion in various complex periodic structures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Finally, the application of pushover analyses allowed the estimation of the structure's maximum load capacity and post-peak behavoir.

	abstract = {The application of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials in concrete structures has been rising due to their several advantages, including lightweight, high tensile strength, ease of installation, and corrosion resistance. They have been mostly implemented for strengthening and repairing existing structures in the form of an externally bonded system, i.e., sheet, jacket, near surface mounted. Furthermore, they have been recently utilized as internal reinforcement of concrete elements in the form of bars, meshes and tendons. Although higher durability and performance are associated with the FRP as compared to steel, this fact does not exclude the possibility of damages and defects, many of which are related to their unique features. For example, debonding of FRP materials from a concrete surface or within a concrete element has occurred and needs to be corrected to avoid the premature failure of a structure. To this end, concrete elements reinforced or strengthened with FRP materials (FRP-RSC) should be inspected periodically to detect potential problems and hence prevent premature failures. This study first determines possible or potential damages and anomalies attributed to FRP-RSC elements. It then investigates Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods that can be applicable to the inspection of FRP reinforced/strengthened concrete elements from a literature survey of past studies, applications, and research projects. Finally, it proposes the most promising methods for detecting FRP and their damage/defects in FRP-RSC elements.

	abstract = {The rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks that initiate from the surface of ferromagnetic materials in aviation bearings and high-speed rails are typically inclined at varying angles, posing a serious threat to safety. Therefore, a rapid and quantitative characterization of inclined cracks is of great importance. This paper investigates the distribution of magnetic fields and motion-induced eddy current (MIEC) in direct current (DC) electromagnetic non-destructive testing (NDT), and proposes an approach for measuring the direction of RCF cracks in moving ferromagnetic materials. The magnetic field and MIEC distributions in the moving ferromagnetic material are initially investigated, followed by a numerical simulation exploring the impact of crack inclination angle and depth on detection signals. The resulting relationship between crack propagation angle, depth, and detection signal is then obtained. Furthermore, a DC electromagnetic NDT platform has been designed and a quantitative detection approach for inclined cracks has been proposed and validated through experiments. Finally, a real scenario detection is carried out. The investigation presented in this paper demonstrates that the DC electromagnetic NDT technique is applicable not only for assessment RCF crack direction in moving ferromagnetic materials, such as rotating aviation bearings, but also for characterizing inclined cracks under conditions of fast relative motion between the probe and the ferromagnetic material (e.g., high-speed rail, pipeline, etc.).},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology of digital shearography for determining the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth under different loading magnitudes for the purpose of nondestructive testing. Digital Shearography, an interferometric nondestructive testing (NDT) technique, has been proven to be a useful tool for material inspections and evaluations, especially for detecting delaminations/disbonds in composite materials and honeycomb structures. A commonly asked question in the field of NDT is about measuring sensitivity - specifically, what is the smallest detectable delamination/disbond and how deep can these be detected? Although various attempts to find the smallest detectable defect by shearography have been made, a numerical model for determining the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth has not yet been developed. This paper did a study in this aspect, especially for NDT of delamination and disbond in polymers and honeycomb structures. First, a mechanical model based on the thin plate theory to calculate the expected bending of close-to-surface defects was proposed; the model built a relationship among the deformation caused by a defect, the size and the depth of the defect, as well as the load and the material properties. Second, the relationship between the relative deformation measured by shearography and the deformation induced by a defect was established based on the optimized shearing amount and the sensitivity of digital shearography. Based on these analyses, relationships between the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth under different load amounts were established for different defect shapes. Finally, experimental validation based on different sizes of prefabricated defects were conducted to verify these relationships. The experimental results show that the model developed can provide useful estimation for NDT by digital shearography, especially with helping test engineers estimate the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth with corresponding loading magnitudes.},

This work presents a sensing concept based on guided electromagnetic waves (GEW), in which the waveguide forms a union with the structure to be inspected. Exploiting ultra-wideband signals a surface defect in the area under the waveguide can be detected and accurately localized. This paper presents numerical and experimental GEW results for a straight waveguide focusing on the detection of through holes and cracks with different orientation. It was found that the numerical model qualitatively replicates the experimental S-parameter measurements for holes of different diameters. A parametric numerical study indicates that the crack parameters such as its orientation and width has a significant influence on the interaction of the incident wave with the structural defect. On top, a numerical study is performed for complex-shaped rectangular waveguides including several waveguide bends. Besides a successful damage detection, the damage position can also be precisely determined with a maximum localization error of less than 3\%.},

	volume = {20},
	doi = {10.1177/1475921720920314},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Detection of mechanical damage using Lamb or Rayleigh waves is limited to relatively simple geometries, yet real structures often incorporate features such as free or clamped edges, welds, rivets, ribs and holes. All these features are potential sources of wave reflections and scattering, which make the application of these types of guided waves for damage detection difficult. However, these features can themselves generate so-called ‘feature-guided’ waves. This article details the first application of the fundamental mode of transient edge waves for detection of mechanical damage. The fundamental edge wave mode (ES $_{\textrm{0}}$ ) – a natural analogue to Rayleigh waves – is weakly dispersive and may decay with propagation distance. The phase and group velocities of the ES $_{\textrm{0}}$ wave mode are close to the fundamental shear horizontal (SH $_{\textrm{0}}$ ) and symmetric Lamb (S $_{\textrm{0}}$ ) wave modes, at low and high frequencies, respectively. It is therefore quite challenging to excite a single ES $_{\textrm{0}}$ mode and avoid wave coupling. However, it was found experimentally that at medium range frequencies the ES $_{\textrm{0}}$ mode can be decoupled from SH $_{\textrm{0}}$ and S $_{\textrm{0}}$ modes, and its decay is small, allowing for distant detection of defects and damage along free edges of slender structural components. This article provides a brief theory of edge waves, excitation methodology and successful examples of distant detection of crack-like and corrosion damage in I-beam sections, which are widely applied in engineering and construction. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A straightforward and efficient enhancement method based on multi-grayscale fusion and edge-weight is proposed to improve the quality of X-ray images. This approach makes use of several established image processing techniques. First, multiple derived images with various grayscales are obtained using three contrast adjustment techniques. The Laplacian pyramid, Gaussian-weighted pyramid, and principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm are then utilized to create a fusion image that displays overall structural information. The bilateral and guided filters are employed to generate an edge-weighted image that contains a lot of edge information. Finally, the edge-weighted image is performed by an exponential operation on the fusion image to obtain a high-contrast image, which is crucial to enhance the detailed features of the image. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method beats previous comparison algorithms in the quantitative index and is capable of fully presenting the internal structures of the samples. Additionally, the enhanced image is satisfactory in detail enhancement, local contrast improvement, and visual sensation.},

	abstract = {Advanced nuclear reactors offer innovative applications due to their portability, reliability, resiliency, and high capacity factors. To operate them on a wider scale, reducing maintenance life-cycle costs while ensuring their integrity is essential. Autonomous operations in advanced nuclear reactors using augmented Digital Twin (DT) technology can serve as a cost-effective solution by increasing awareness about the system’s health. A key component of nuclear DT frameworks is the condition monitoring of safety systems, such as piping-equipment systems, which involves acquiring and monitoring the plant’s sensor data. This research proposes a condition monitoring methodology utilizing deep learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptions (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect degradation and its severity in nuclear piping-equipment systems. Sensor signals are processed to obtain the power spectral density and the Short-Time Fourier transform, and feature extraction methodologies are proposed to develop degradation-sensitive data repositories. The performance of MLP, one-dimensional (1D) CNN, and 2D CNN within the proposed condition monitoring framework is compared using a finite element model of a 3D piping system subjected to seismic loads as the application case study. Various approaches, such as dropout, k-Fold validation, regularization, and early stopping of training the network, are investigated to avoid overfitting the models to the input sensor data. The predictive capability and computational capacity of the deep learning algorithms are also compared to detect degradation in the Z-pipe system of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBRII). The Z-pipe system is subjected to harmonic excitations that represent normal operating loads, such as pump-induced vibrations. The findings of the study indicate that the proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-driven condition monitoring framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracies with a 2D CNN, whereas the MLP exhibits higher computational efficiency.},

	abstract = {As plate-like structures are widely used in railway vehicle systems, structural health monitoring and nondestructive testing of those structures are important. The Lamb wave, as an ultrasonic guided wave propagating in plate-like structures, is an effective tool for fault diagnosis. The Capon method is widely used in Lamb wave based damage imaging due to its superior performance in suppressing background noise compared with the conventional delay-and-sum method. As the conventional Capon method is sensitive to modeling errors like the inaccuracy of the look-direction, diagonal loading is usually adopted to regularize the inverse of the covariance matrix. However, the degree of diagonal loading is related to the accuracy of the given look-direction and is hard to determine accurately. Aimed at improving the imaging quality of the conventional Capon method, an adaptive Capon method with adaptive diagonal loading is proposed. In the proposed method, the dispersion and the amplitude caused by wave diffusion are first compensated for each imaging point using the virtual time reversal technique. The correlations among the compensated waveforms after windowing are used to determine the degree of diagonal loading. In the process of regularizing the inverse of the covariance matrix, a large diagonal loading factor will be applied when the correlations among the compensated waveforms are large. As correlations are closely related to the signal phase, both the amplitude and the phase of scattering signals are utilized in the proposed method. The numerical and experimental validations on an aluminum plate are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that compared with the conventional Capon method, the proposed method can obtain images with higher imaging quality, fewer artifacts, and lower noise.},

The imaging result is exemplified numerically and experimentally, with the strengths and drawbacks explained thoroughly. Remarkably, the thickness error of the simple defect is still within 0.5 mm when the input data is poor.

The existence and application of those local resonances have been extensively reported in plate and pipe structures. However, local resonances in rails are rarely studied. The team recently reported that impulse dynamic tests can promote the local resonances in rails up to 40 kHz, and the results were verified using both semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) analysis and frequency-domain fully discretized finite element analysis. In this work, we present the discovery of ZGV modes and cutoff frequency resonances in free rails up to 80 kHz using piezoelectric elements. A miniature low-cost PZT patch works as a consistent excitation source compared with the impulse dynamic testing method. First, we implement the SAFE analysis to compute dispersion curves of a standard AREMA 115RE rail and to identify potential ZGV and cutoff frequency points up to 80 kHz. Then, to understand the existence and detectability of identified ZGV and cutoff points in a free rail, we install one PZT patch on the side of the rail head. A chirp signal covering 20 to 120 kHz is selected as the excitation to cover the desired frequency range. Finally, we perform a spatial sampling of wave propagation using three receivers along the wave propagation direction to calculate the dispersion relations experimentally via two-dimensional Fourier Transforms (2D-FFT). This study verifies the existence of ZGV modes in free rail up to 80 kHz and demonstrates the feasibility of using piezoelectric elements to generate local resonances.},

However, the use of a piezoelectric sensor's network to locate and image damaged areas in composite structures requires a number of precautions including the consideration of anisotropy and baseline signals. The lack of information related to these two parameters drastically deteriorates the imaging performance of numerous signal processing methods. To avoid such deterioration, the present contribution proposes different methods to build baseline signals in different types of composites. Baseline signals are first constructed from a numerical simulation model using the previously determined elasticity tensor of the structure. Since the latter tensor is not always easy to obtain especially in the case of anisotropic materials, a second PZT network is used in order to obtain signals related to Lamb waves propagating in different directions. Waveforms are then translated according to a simplified theoretical propagation model of Lamb waves in homogeneous structures. The application of the different methods on transversely isotropic, unidirectional and quasi-transversely isotropic composites allows to have satisfactory images that well represent the damaged areas with the help of the delay-and-sum algorithm.},

	abstract = {During the whole life cycle of solid rocket motor (SRM), shell damage and propellant interface debonding will occur, which will destroy the structural integrity of SRM. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the SRM health status, and the existing nondestructive testing technology and the designed optical fiber sensor cannot meet the monitoring requirements. In order to solve this problem, this paper uses femtosecond laser direct writing technology to write high contrast short femtosecond grating array. A new packaging method is proposed to enable the sensor array to measure 9000 με. It solves the grating chirp phenomenon caused by stress concentration in the SRM, and breaks through the key technology of fiber optic sensor implantation in the SRM. The shell pressure test and strain monitoring inside the SRM during long-term storage are realized. For the first time, the experiments of tearing and shearing specimens were simulated. Compared with the results of computed tomography, it proves the accuracy and progressiveness of implantable optical fiber sensing technology. Combined with theory and experiment, the problem of SRM life cycle health monitoring is solved.},

Wrinkles in composite GFRP plates with different weave patterns (twill and satin) have been manufactured with the use of the vacuum bagging method. The different localization of defects in laminates has been taken into account. Transmission and reflection measurement techniques of active thermography have been verified and compared. The section of a turbine blade with a vertical axis of rotation containing post-manufacturing wrinkles has been prepared to verify active thermography measurement techniques in the real structure. In the turbine blade section, the influence of a gelcoat surface on the effectiveness of thermography damage detection has also been taken into account. Straightforward thermal parameters applied in structural health monitoring systems allow an effective damage detection method to be built. The transmission IRT setup allows not only for damage detection and localization in composite structures but also for accurate damage identification. The reflection IRT setup is convenient for damage detection systems coupled with nondestructive testing software.

	abstract = {Aiming to provide more efficient, lightweight structures, composite materials are being extensively used in aerospace vehicles. As the failure mechanisms of these materials are complex, damage detection becomes challenging, requiring advanced techniques for assessing structural integrity and maintaining aircraft safety. In this context, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) seeks for integrating sensors into the structures in a way that Nondestructive Testing (NDT) is implemented continuously. One promising approach is to use Fiber Optic Sensors (FOS) to acquire strain signals, taking advantages of their capabilities over conventional sensors. Despite several works have developed Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) using FOS for performing in-flight SHM in aircraft structures, automatic damage detection using the acquired signals has not been achieved in a robust way against environmental and operational variability, in all flight stages or considering different types of damages. In this work, a HUMS was developed and implemented in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on 20 Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) embedded into the composite front spar of the aircraft’s wing, a miniaturized data acquisition subsystem for gathering strain signals and a wireless transmission subsystem for remote sensing. The HUMS was tested in 16 flights, six of them were carried out with the pristine structure and the remaining after inducing different artificial damages. The in-flight data were used to validate a previously developed damage detection methodology based on strain field pattern recognition, or strain mapping, which utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based procedure for clustering operational conditions and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in conjunction with damage indices for final classification. The performance of the damage detection demonstrated a highest accuracy of 0.981 and a highest F1 score of 0.978. As a main contribution, this work implements in-flight strain monitoring, remote sensing and automatic damage detection in an operating composite aircraft structure.},

As a promising nondestructive testing method, the electromechanical impedance (EMI) method has been widely applied in the field of structure health monitoring (SHM) in civil engineering. In this study, this method was explored in monitoring the stiffness degradation of hardened cement paste subjected to compression loadings. Based on the theoretical modelling, a simplified one-dimensional analytical model was established based upon the piezo-elasticity theory to interpret the correlation between the PZT transducer and the cement specimen in the presence of uniaxial compression loading. Moreover, by embedding the PZT transducer inside cement specimens, the conductance signatures in two different frequency ranges throughout the entire loading process were captured and analyzed. It is revealed that the trend of the EMI spectra is compatible with the cement deterioration. More importantly, the resonance frequency and the statistic metric correlation coefficient (CC) can serve as good indicators to quantitatively assess the stiffness degradation of cement paste under uniaxial compression loadings. This research well validates the effectiveness and applicability of the EMI method in real-time monitoring of cement stiffness degradation under compression loadings.},

The goal is to evaluate the working range and SHM potential of such embedded transducers for relatively simple mechanical loadings, with the long-term aim of using them to monitor complete 3D structures submitted to more complex loadings. SHM is performed acquiring the electrical capacitance variation of the embedded transducers. To study the potential links between the in-situ capacitance signal and the global response of the loaded host specimens, a multi-instrumentation composed of external Nondestructive Testing techniques was implemented on the surfaces of the specimens to search for multi-physical couplings between these external measurements and the capacitance curves. Results confirmed the non-intrusiveness of the embedded transducers, and allowed estimating their working domain. PZT capacitance signal follows well the mechanical loadings, but the piezoceramic transducer gets damaged after a determined relatively low strain level due to its brittleness. The limits of this working domain are extended by using a stretchable PolyVinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) polymer transducer, allowing this one to perform in-situ and real-time SHM of its host tensile specimens until failure.},

In the general Lamb wave inspection, difference between the baselines and the measured signals are used for structural damage evaluation. However, the baselines are unavoidably influenced by operational and environmental conditions leads to an increased error during inspection. To deal with this issue, this paper presents a base-line free method based on the mode conversion and reciprocity principle of Lamb wave. Once the defect is asymmetrical with respect to the transducer pair (two identical piezoelectric transducers used as actuator and receiver respectively), the elastic wave path length of the converted mode will be different, resulting in failing of the reciprocity principle. By processing the signals received by the transducer pair and extracting the time parameters of the wave packets in mode conversion signals, the defect can be localized. Results from the signals generated by numerical simulation are presented to verify the feasibility of the method, and the effectiveness of the proposed baseline-free method is demonstrated with experimental results.},

	abstract = {The scientific community is hardly working to propose reliable methodologies of analysis and non-invasive technologies of investigation to assess the current state of conservation of historic buildings to verify their ability to resist future threats. These structures, mostly made of masonry, are difficult to assess due to the heterogeneity of materials and their mechanical behavior, but it is vital to preserve this invaluable cultural heritage by suitable structural assessment techniques. A great deal of research attention has been paid to monitoring their structural health; in many recent publications new advanced technological methods have been provided such as cheaper sensors, wireless connections, non-contact surveys and continuous monitoring. A bibliometric study has shown that more than half of the papers on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Nondestructive Testing (NDT) on masonry have been published between 2018 and 2020, and 30\% of those published in 2020 were on ‘slender’ elements like towers, chimneys or minarets. This paper presents a wide-ranging review of static and dynamic studies published on SHM and NDT of slender masonry structures summarizing and discussing the different experimental techniques used. With respect to the dynamic testing, Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) by accelerometers is the mostly frequent used technique by scholars, but other promising methods such as radar interferometry are also reported. This overall discussion is concluded with a short review of some examples on numerical structural health assessment and signal processing tools. An inclusive list of papers is provided describing the most important slender masonry structures characteristics, natural frequencies, experimental and numerical techniques employed and reference values. This paper, set on a practical perspective, is expected to be of interest to those researchers and practitioners who require an extensive and up-to-date review of this topic.},

In this method, two different microstrip-based designs are mounted on metal, spiral, and comb sensing structures. Both sensing structures are interrogated by a 2.45 GHz signal in CST Microwave Studio, and their sensitivities for crack detection are compared through the S$_{\textrm{11}}$ scattering parameter. We demonstrate that measuring the reflected signal’s phase parameter from a sensor on a damaged metal provides information from the surface crack by comparing it to the same metal without any crack. The vision is to provide a new chipless, low-cost sensor with increased detection reliability and durability in harsh environments. Simulation results of the comb sensing (CS) structure show that the signal phase shift caused by a crack envisions the possibility of submillimeter-width crack detection through smart structures.},

To validate the proposed method, first, a well-known benchmark model is numerically simulated. Using acceleration response histories, as well as compressed response data in terms of discrete histograms, CNN models are trained, and the robustness of the CNN architectures is evaluated. Finally, pretrained CNNs are fine-tuned to be adaptable for three-parameter, extremely compressed response data, based on the response mean, standard deviation, and a scale factor. The performance of each CNN implementation is assessed using training accuracy histories as well as confusion matrices, along with other performance metrics. In addition to the numerical study, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using experimental vibration response data for verification and validation.

	abstract = {Damage detection is one of the most important tasks for structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure. Before a damage detection algorithm can be applied, the integrity of the data must be ensured; otherwise results may be misleading or incorrect. Indeed, sensor system malfunction, which results in anomalous data (often called faulty data), is a serious problem, as the sensors usually must operate in extremely harsh environments. Identifying and eliminating anomalies in the data is crucial to ensuring that reliable monitoring results can be achieved. Because of the vast amounts of data typically collected by a structural health monitoring system, manual removal of the anomalous data is prohibitive. Machine learning methods have the potential to automate the process of data anomaly detection. Although supervised methods have been proven to be effective for detecting data anomalies, two unresolved challenges reduce the accuracy of anomaly detection: (1) the class imbalance and (2) incompleteness of anomalous patterns of training dataset. Unsupervised methods have the potential to address these challenges, but improvements are required to deal with vast amounts of monitoring data. In this article, the generative adversarial networks are combined with a widely applied unsupervised method, that is, autoencoders, to improve the performance of existing unsupervised learning methods. In addition, the time-series data are transformed to Gramian Angular Field images so that advanced computer vision methods can be included in the network. Two structural health monitoring datasets from a full-scale bridge, including examples of anomalous data caused by sensor system malfunctions, are utilized to validate the proposed methodology. Results show that the proposed methodology can successfully identify data anomalies with good accuracy and robustness, hence can overcome one of the key difficulties in achieving automated structural health monitoring.},

Due to the computer vision technology application advantages such as non-contact, long distance, rapid, low cost and labor, and low interference to the daily operation of structures, it is promising to consider computer vision–structural health monitoring as a complement to the conventional structural health monitoring. This article presents a general overview of the concepts, approaches, and real-life practice of computer vision–structural health monitoring along with some relevant literature that is rapidly accumulating. The computer vision–structural health monitoring covered in this article at local level includes applications such as crack, spalling, delamination, rust, and loose bolt detection. At the global level, applications include displacement measurement, structural behavior analysis, vibration serviceability, modal identification, model updating, damage detection, cable force monitoring, load factor estimation, and structural identification using input–output information. The current research studies and applications of computer vision–structural health monitoring mainly focus on the implementation and integration of two-dimensional computer vision techniques to solve structural health monitoring problems and the projective geometry methods implemented are utilized to convert the three-dimensional problems into two-dimensional problems. This review mainly puts emphasis on two-dimensional computer vision–structural health monitoring applications. Subsequently, a brief review of representative developments of three-dimensional computer vision in the area of civil engineering is presented along with the challenges and opportunities of two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer vision–structural health monitoring.

In this article, a novel NDT method for the structural health monitoring from the different perspective is proposed, which is based on the structural system model between the exciting input and output response. Nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) is used to establish the time domain model between the input signal and the output response. Frequency response (FRF) of NARMAX model from the time domain data is proposed to obtain the indicators to assess the structural health. The effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method are tested with two sets of experimental data by comparison with the existing method.},

	abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage assessment of civil engineering infrastructure are complex tasks. Structural health and strength of structures are influenced by various factors, such as the material production stage, transportation, placement, workmanship, formwork removal, and concrete curing. Technological advancements and the widespread availability of Wi-Fi networks has resulted in SHM shifting from traditional wire-based methods to Internet of Things (IoT)-based real-time wireless sensors. Comprehensive structural health assessment can be performed through the efficient use of real-time test data on structures obtained from various types of IoT sensors, which monitor several health parameters of structures, available on cloud-based data storage systems. The sensor data may be subsequently used for various applications, such as forecasting masonry construction deterioration, predicting the early-stage compressive strength of concrete, forecasting the optimum time for the removal of formwork, vibration and curing quality control, crack detection in buildings, pothole detection on roads, determination of the construction quality, corrosion diagnosis, identification of various damage typologies and seismic vulnerability assessment. This review paper summarizes the applications of the wireless IoT technology in the monitoring of civil engineering infrastructure. In addition, several case studies on real structures and laboratory investigations for monitoring the structural health of civil engineering constructions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) has become an important and hot topic for decades in various fields of civil, mechanical, automotive, and aerospace engineering, etc. Estimating the health condition and understanding the unique characteristics of structures through assessing measured physical parameters in real-time is the major objective of SHM. As a result, signal processing becomes an essential and inseparable approach of vibration based SHM research. The basic goal of using signal processing is to identify the changes or damages from the vibration signals of the dynamic system to detect, locate, and quantify any damages existing in the system. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent progress that used signal processing techniques for vibration based SHM approaches. Furthermore, the feature extraction process through the signal processing techniques is the basic skeleton of this review. The application of signal processing techniques in structural damage identification procedure is classified into two approaches, namely (i) time-domain and (ii) frequency-domain. Experimental studies have assessed the potentials of the signal processing techniques in two aforementioned domains to enhance the vibration-based structural damage detection subjected to environmental effects. While there have been multiple review studies published on vibration-based structural damage detection, there exists no study in categorizing the signal processing techniques based on the feature extraction procedure that belongs to time and frequency domains for SHM purposes. This review fills this gap and presents a holistic summary of the cutting-edge methodology and technique applied in the relevant research field.},

	abstract = {The application of machine learning within Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been widely successful in a variety of applications. However, most techniques are built upon the assumption that both training and test data were drawn from the same underlying distribution. This fact means that unless test data were obtained from the same system in the same operating conditions, the machine learning inferences from the training data will not provide accurate predictions when applied to the test data. Therefore, to train a robust predictor conventionally, new training data and labels must be recollected for every new structure considered, which is significantly expensive and often impossible in an SHM context. Transfer learning, in the form of domain adaptation, offers a novel solution to these problems by providing a method for mapping feature and label distributions for different structures, labelled source and unlabelled target structures, onto the same space. As a result, classifiers trained on a labelled structure in the source domain will generalise to a different unlabelled target structure. Furthermore, a holistic discussion of contexts in which domain adaptation is applicable are discussed, specifically for population-based SHM. Three domain adaptation techniques are demonstrated on four case studies providing new frameworks for approaching the problem of SHM.},

	abstract = {The development of a viable structural health monitoring (SHM) technology for the operational condition monitoring of wind turbine blades is of great interest to the wind industry. In order for any SHM technology to achieve the technical readiness and performance required for an operational implementation, advanced signal processing algorithms need to be developed to adaptively remove noise and retain the underlying signals of interest that describe the damage-related information. The wavelet packet transform decomposes a measured time domain signal into a time-frequency representation enabling the removal of noise that may overlap with the signal of interest in time and/or frequency. However, the traditional technique suffers from several assumptions limiting its applicability in an operational SHM environment, where the noise conditions commonly exhibit erratic behavior. Furthermore, an exhaustive number of options exist when selecting the parameters used in the technique with limited guidelines that can help select the most appropriate options for a given application. Appropriately defining the technique tends to be a daunting task resulting in a general avoidance of the approach in the field of SHM. This work outlines an adaptive wavelet packet denoising algorithm applicable to numerous SHM technologies including acoustics, vibrations, and acoustic emission. The algorithm incorporates a blend of non-traditional approaches for noise estimation, threshold selection, and threshold application to augment the denoising performance of real-time structural health monitoring measurements. Appropriate wavelet packet parameters are selected through a simulation considering the trade-off between signal to noise ratio improvement and amount of signal energy retained. The wavelet parameter simulation can be easily replicated to accommodate any SHM technology where the underlying signal of interest is known, as is the case in most active-based approaches including acoustic and wave-propagation techniques. The finalized adaptive wavelet packet algorithm is applied to a comprehensive dataset demonstrating an active acoustic damage detection approach on a {\textasciitilde}46 m wind turbine blade. The quality of the measured data and the damage detection performance obtained from simple spectral filtering is compared with the proposed wavelet packet technique. It is shown that the damage detection performance is enhanced in all but one test case by as much as 60\%, and the false detection rate is reduced. The approach and the subsequent results presented in this paper are expected to help enable advancement in the performance of several established SHM technologies and identifies the considered acoustics-based SHM approach as a noteworthy option for wind turbine blade structural health monitoring.},

Near real-time and online damage assessment in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems is a promising transition toward bridging the gaps between the past’s applicative inefficiencies and the emerging technologies of the future. In the age of the smart city, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data analytics, the complex nature of data-driven civil infrastructures monitoring frameworks has not been fully matured. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are thus providing the necessary tools to augment the capabilities of SHM systems and provide intelligent solutions for the challenges of the past. This article aims to clarify and review the ML frontiers involved in modern SHM systems. A detailed analysis of the ML pipelines is provided, and the in-demand methods and algorithms are summarized in augmentative tables and figures. Connecting the ubiquitous sensing and big data processing of critical information in infrastructures through the IoT paradigm is the future of SHM systems. In line with these digital advancements, considering the next-generation SHM and ML combinations, recent breakthroughs in (1) mobile device-assisted, (2) unmanned aerial vehicles, (3) virtual/augmented reality, and (4) digital twins are discussed at length. Finally, the current and future challenges and open research issues in SHM-ML conjunction are examined. The roadmap of utilizing emerging technologies within ML-engaged SHM is still in its infancy; thus, the article offers an outlook on the future of monitoring systems in assessing civil infrastructure integrity.},

	abstract = {The widespread application of sophisticated structural health monitoring systems in civil infrastructures produces a large volume of data. As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learning–based data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.},

At present, structural safety inspections based on nondestructive testing procedures mainly focus on qualitative analysis; hence, it is difficult to identify the scale of flaws quantitatively. In this article, an inversion model that can realize quantitative detection is proposed by combing the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) with deep learning. First, the lamb wave propagation processes in thin structures containing flaws were simulated using the SBFEM, and the echo wave signal at an observation point was recorded and paired with the flaw information. Then, the paired SBFEM datasets were used to train the deep learning model employing a convolutional neural network. A flaw classification and identification model based on SBFEM datasets was established. For a thin structure with unknown flaw information, and by using the measured observation point signals, the established deep learning model can predict flaw information in real time. Finally, the model performance was verified using several numerical examples. The results show that the proposed model can accurately predict flaw information and is robust against noise; thus, it offers an advantage over existing nondestructive testing procedures and a development in the field of structural health monitoring.},

	abstract = {Structural health diagnosis and prognosis is the goal of structural health monitoring. Vibration-based structural health monitoring methodology has been extensively investigated. However, the conventional vibration–based methods find it difficult to detect damages of actual structures because of a high incompleteness in the monitoring information (the number of sensors is much fewer with respect to the number of degrees of freedom of a structure), intense uncertainties in the structural conditions and monitoring systems, and coupled effects of damage and environmental actions on modal parameters. It is a truth that the performance and conditions of a structure must be embedded in the monitoring data (vehicles, wind, etc.; acceleration, displacement, cable force, strain, images, videos, etc.). Therefore, there is a need to develop completely novel structural health diagnosis and prognosis methodology based on the various monitoring data. Machine learning provides the advanced mathematical frameworks and algorithms that can help discover and model the performance and conditions of a structure through deep mining of monitoring data. Thus, machine learning takes an opportunity to establish novel machine learning paradigm for structural health diagnosis and prognosis theory termed the machine learning paradigm for structural health monitoring.

	abstract = {Damage in the precast concrete piles occurs mostly during installation. The wave propagation-based nondestructive testing (NDT) is commonly used to estimate the effective length of the pile after installation and to detect pile damage. However, information extracted from this type of diagnosis is limited and subjective. Whereas, the vibration-based NDT could provide a comprehensive automatic pile health diagnosis tool. In this paper, a new higher order vibration-based health diagnosis technology, which utilizes a shaker to generate sweep-sine excitation and an adaptive nonlinear non-stationary higher order spectral analysis, is introduced for foundation piles. This research describes two different diagnostic technologies, namely, the advanced nonlinear non-stationary chirp Fourier bicoherence (CFB) technology and the novel nonlinear non-stationary frequency response function of the CFB (FRF-CFB) technology. The CFB is a technology which is capable of quantifying the amplitude and phase coupling between harmonics of pile resonance oscillations caused by a damage. However, in practices, the amplitude and phase coupling between harmonics of pile resonance oscillations may be caused also due to the phase-coupled harmonics of an interference imposed by an excitation source (e.g., shaker). Therefore, the novel diagnosis technology, FRF-CFB, which detects nonlinearity caused solely by a structural damage, is proposed and implemented for real-scale precast concrete piles. It is found that the FRF-CFB technology successfully identifies the damaged piles. Finally, the diagnosis based on the conventional pile integrity testing, conducted on the same piles, is presented for comparisons with the FRF-CFB technology and with the CFB technology.},

The damages accumulating with time may lead to a significant decrease in structure performance or even destruction; natural symmetry is broken, resulting in an unexpected life and economic loss. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the structural response to detect the damage in an early stage, evaluate the health condition of structures, and ensure the operation safety of structures. In fact, the structure and the evaluation can be considered as a special symmetry. Among several SHM methods, vibration-based SHM techniques have been widely adopted recently. Hence, this paper reviews the vibration-based SHM methods in terms of the vibrational parameters used. In addition, the technical codes on vibration based SHM system have also been reviewed, since they are more important in engineering applications. Several related ISO standards and national codes have been developed and implemented, while more specific technical codes are still required to provide more detailed guidelines in practice to maintain structure safety and natural symmetry.},

	abstract = {To perform a comprehensive assessment of important infrastructures (like bridges), the process of structural health monitoring (SHM) is employed. The development and implementation of SHM systems are generally based on wireless sensor networks (WSN) platforms. However, most of the WSN platforms are battery-powered, and therefore, have a limited battery lifetime. The power constraint is generally addressed by applying energy harvesting (EH) technologies. As a result, there exists a plethora of WSN platforms and EH techniques. The employment of a particular platform and technique are important factors during the development and implementation of SHM systems and depend upon various operating conditions. Therefore, there is a need to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) for WSN platforms and EH techniques in the context of SHM for bridges. Although state-of-the-art review articles present multiple angles of the field, there is a lack of an SLR presenting an in-depth comparative study of different WSN platforms and EH techniques. Moreover, a systematic analysis is also needed for the exploration of other design considerations such as inspection scale (global/local), response type (static/dynamic), and types of sensors. As a result, this SLR selects 46 articles (during 2007-2023), related to EH techniques and WSN platforms in SHM for bridges. The selected articles are classified into three groups: WSN platforms, energy harvesting techniques, and a combination of both. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of WSN platforms and EH techniques is made. Furthermore, the selected articles (total = 46) are also explored in terms of sensor type, inspection scale, and response type. As a result, 17 different sensor types are identified. This research is significant as it may facilitate the various stakeholders of the domain during the selection of appropriate WSN platforms, EH techniques, and related design issues.},

	abstract = {Bending evanescent waves are among the promising approaches for the local damage identification of slender beams due to the high sensitivity and spatial concentrating nature. However, such local damage usually appears near the boundary of the beam in practices. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the evanescent wave components resulting from the boundary and the crack, leading to confusion in damage identification. In order to tackle this issue, the generalized reflection coefficient of the evanescent wave with respect to the incident propagating wave (GRC-EP) is exploited in the present work, which allows to quantitatively identify the severity of the near-boundary crack. Taking the semi-infinite Timoshenko beam having a crack damage at the fixed end, the generalized reflections of the evanescent and propagating waves at the crack, with respect to a unit incident wave, are derived analytically, showing that the amplitude of the evanescent wave is negatively related to the damage severity. Based on this, the amplitude ratio between the reflected evanescent wave and the incident propagating wave, i.e., the GRC as mentioned, is proposed to be the damage indicator. Referring to the theoretical GRC values, the damage severity can then be identified from the estimated GRCs that are obtained from the inverse algorithm, as long as the acceleration responses are given. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed indicator is verified by taking a slender beam having a local damage at the fixed end as an example. The results show that the proposed GRC-EP is capable to indicate the severity of the near-boundary damage despite the consideration of noise, confirming its potential value in the health monitoring of slender beam structures.},

This work develops a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian framework for structural full-field dynamic vibration quantification and modal shape visualization and validates its performance through vision-based vibration experiments. By assuming a linear vibration system, modal responses that are estimated from the vibration signals on a structural surface provide a reliable basis for manipulating temporal and spatial vibrations in Eulerian motion processing. Then, dynamic spatial motion can be quantified by using the improved non-rigid image registration algorithm. Meanwhile, from the Lagrangian perspective, high-quality visualization of modal shapes is implemented by compensating spatial motion according to magnified dense displacement fields. The experiment results showed that the proposed hybrid framework has superiority in controlled modal tests and has potential for more practical applications.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of fatigue damage using nonlinear guided wave mixing has been studied extensively over the past decade. It was found that the combinational harmonics as a result of wave mixing of quasi-synchronized wave modes show attractive features and are sensitive to fatigue damage. However, there were very limited studies on the frequency pair selection and time shifting of the wave mixing signals. In this study, a method is developed and theoretical equations are implemented, which provides a guide on the selection of the wave mixing frequency pair. The proposed frequency pair selection method can advance the trial-and-error method that was generally used for low-frequency wave mixing, which has a large number of possible frequency pairs, and deliberate selection is needed to avoid the overlapping of the generated harmonics. A new time shifting technique is also proposed to enhance the generation of second and combinational harmonics due to the collinear wave mixing. This technique can be very useful when there are various limitations exist on the selection of the excitation frequencies. The efficiency of the proposed method is validated by a series of numerical and experimental studies. Overall, the new findings can be utilized to further advance the development of new damage detection methods using the guided wave mixing method.},

	abstract = {A direct phase estimation (DPE) via Riesz transform from a speckle pattern (images) for visualizing barely visible impact damage (BVID) occurring in layered composites is proposed in this paper. Rather than complex optical hardware setup for phase extraction in commercial digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) or shearography (SG) systems, the proposed numerical (software) DPE implementation via Riesz transform with a log-Gabor filter enables a compact, portable, and cost-effective system for large-area real-time nondestructive inspection (NDI) due to its simplicity, stability, and efficiency. Using speckles in laser speckle interferometry (LSI) speckle pattern is intrinsically noisy; the correlation-based phase signatures derived from Riesz transform followed by the log-Gabor filter is implemented to supplant the conventional phase-difference algorithm to localize damage regions, especially in the case where the high-power diode laser (low coherence) can cause serious phase drift. By enveloping the monogenic signal through Riesz transform for direct phase retrieval is more intuitive than TPS or SPS. This yields visualization of the damage feature with higher fidelity. Consequently, a phase-correlation algorithm becomes a more robust operation to cope with speckle images from the interferometry. This full-field optical SG system was demonstrated and verified in an impacted damaged honeycomb composite panel using the proposed phase-correlation algorithm under thermal stress loading for large-area inspection in near real-time. The visualized damage images enhanced by principal component analysis (PCA) agreed with images from pulse laser/LDV and X-ray CT scan. The DPE algorithm has a promising potential to apply on any optical metrology for instantaneous phase estimation and can combine with selected imaging conditions for multi-damage detection.},

The AR parameters are determined by the knowledge-based method for improving applicability. Meanwhile, the weighted TFM imaging with different effective frequency bands is applied to extract and highlight the target characteristics, enhancing the robustness of the proposed method. The simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the side-drilled holes (SDHs) with 0.7λ (wavelength λ) central distance can be identified with accurate location by WTFM.

	abstract = {Lamb wave minimum variance imaging is a promising method for visual damage identification and localization with a sparse transducer array. Imaging performance of minimum variance is highly dependent on the design accuracy of look-direction to describe amplitude relationship of array reflection signals. Look-direction is the combination of a directivity reflection pattern and an attenuation with propagation distance. However, reflection pattern is closely related to damage parameters (e.g. type, orientation and size) and these parameters are usually unknown beforehand. Therefore, accurate design of look-direction is difficult or even impossible, and design error can significantly degrade imaging performance. To overcome this limitation, a modified minimum variance method is proposed in this study. Besides amplitude information, waveform information is integrated into algorithm imaging procedure. Correlation coefficient between local signal and excitation waveform is calculated to generate the distribution of weights for diagonal loading. Diagonal loading weight is an adjustable coefficient in minimum variance algorithm to control the tolerance for look-direction error. With larger weights for potential damage locations, tolerance for inaccuracy in look-direction is increased, and imaging performance is accordingly improved. Experiments on both aluminum plates and composite laminates are carried out to demonstrate the performance improvement of modified method.},

	abstract = {The increasing mechanical and economical demands in modern systems and structures are forcing an inevitable need for joining dissimilar materials, thus creating the challenge of establishing a process to inspect and monitor dissimilar joints. Condition monitoring is a necessity to ensure that the structures are being safely used and to extend their lifetime. Lamb waves (LWs) are ultrasonic guided waves that are widely used for structural health monitoring of mechanical, aerospace, and civil structures. This paper proposes a novel structural health monitoring approach for damage detection, localization, and assessment using a minimal LW sensor-actuator set-up. More specifically, the proposed framework provides damage detection, localization and assessment within a dissimilar-material joint by Bayesian inference of six parameters of damage extent and location. Finite element simulations are used to simulate the measured LWs and generate a dataset required to train artificial neural networks (ANN), acting as surrogate models for LW simulation with reduced computational cost. The ANN-based LW simulations are further used as forward model within an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework to provide probabilistic inference of the damage size and position. The results show that damage of different sizes and locations can be successfully identified with a high level of resolution and with quantified uncertainty. The results also show that data fusion for ABC inference using multiple sensor measurements can be possible with improved inference results. However, a precise and robust damage inference can be achieved using a minimal sensing set-up based on one actuator and two sensing points, with consideration of certain levels of measurement noise. These findings imply a considerable reduction of complexity of LW actuator-sensor networks, and overall, they imply a significant reduction of computational resources and cost for damage detection and assessment in structures, thus providing a step forward towards online/onboard monitoring applications.},

However, stress concentration and neutral axis change near cracks make the assumptions of classical beam theory invalid.

In the present work, a method for quantifying damage in simply supported beams from modal curvature is analytically developed, highlighting the hypotheses upon which it relies. Then, a wide variety of cases (thousands) are parametrically modeled by using solid finite elements. The considered universe involves different materials; section types; crack locations, positions and sizes; sensor positions and locations; and beam dimensions. From the modal analysis results, damage indicators that are based on modal curvature are tested for their damage-quantification capability.

Thus, interesting conclusions are found about the limitations and advantages of this damage-quantification method. Also, useful recommendations are provided for defining suitable positions and locations of sensors in beams.

	abstract = {The air-coupled ultrasonic technique is a reliable method for measuring the stress state of composite plates. This paper aims to address the requirement for efficient and accurate stress measurement of large component composite plates by proposing an air-coupled ultrasonic in-situ measurement method. Ultrasonic Lamb waves can propagate over long distances while maintaining sensitivity to slight changes and are suitable for in-situ stress measurement of CFRP plates. However, due to the serious mismatch in acoustic impedance, the air-coupled ultrasonic Lamb waves have a low signal-to-noise ratio, which can affect the accuracy of stress measurement. Focusing on this problem, the method employs the Lyapunov exponent with a moving window to accurately extract the acoustic-time characteristic instead of just judging the presence or absence of a weak signal compared with the traditional method of using the Lyapunov exponent. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in different fiber directions of CFRP plates, seven uniaxial tensile specimens are obtained along 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90° fiber directions, respectively. Utilize stress coefficient calibration results KL to realize the uniaxial stress measurement with a spatial resolution of 150 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that the stress measurement errors are within ±7.29 MPa in the range of 0–150 MPa, and the standard deviations of the repeatability measurement experiment are below 4.57 MPa. The proposed method exhibits significant advantages in terms of measurement accuracy and repeatability compared with traditional stress methods based on peak extraction or cross-correlation. It is a suitable technique for health monitoring and evaluation of composite plates.},

Multimode response involving two fundamental modes, i.e., flexural and axial, and two higher-order wave-modes, i.e., shear and thickness contraction have been considered in the present work. The model is based on higher order beam theory which uses wave kinematics to extract individual wave modes from the multimode response. Further, a numerical finite element model is employed to validate the deformation profile of this analytical model. The embedment of thin film sensors at the same location but within different layers produce signals that exhibit a relative difference in the phase and amplitude due to kinematics. The sensor signals are then post-processed to obtain individual Lamb wave modes. Experiments are carried out to validate the procedure for extracting individual guided wave mode response. The method is independent of sampling rate and works in the presence of complicated mode converted responses. Electronic analog circuits can also be used to perform operations on sensor signals before analog-to-digital conversion, thereby eliminating digital signal processing and the requirement of onboard computers for structural health monitoring especially in aircraft. Such capability minimizes power consumption and weight since we may be able to avoid the use of a computer.},

	abstract = {The complex design of composite structures makes it very difficult for conventional visual inspection techniques to detect defects in these materials. Therefore, numerous types of nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring techniques have been developed for damage identification in composite structures, among which ultrasonic guided waves, particularly Lamb waves, have gained much popularity. In recent years, apart from piezoelectric pointwise measurements, laser Doppler vibrometry has been used for full wavefield measurements of propagating Lamb waves. Damage imaging can be done with animations of Lamb waves interacting with defects. In this work, two end-to-end deep learning-based models of many-to-one sequence prediction were developed to perform pixel-wise image segmentation. A large dataset of full wavefield images resulting from the interaction with delamination of random size, shape, and location was utilised to train the proposed deep learning models. The main goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of implementing deep learning methods for delamination identification in composite laminates by only utilising the animations of Lamb waves. The elaborated models worked well on the numerically generated test data and have also shown good performance on the real-world experimental data. These methods can enable the automation of delamination identification and to create damage maps without the intervention of the user.},

	abstract = {Irregular and complex cross-sectional waveguide structures exhibit numerous guided wave modes, which become mixed at high frequencies and hinder mode identification and application in damage monitoring. To address the need for single mode excitation in nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring, this study presents a comb excitation method based on group velocity that aims to excite a single guided wave mode in irregular and complex cross-sectional waveguides. Using rails as a case study for simulation and validation of the excitation effect, array comb sensors are arranged along the rail web. By adjusting the time delay and phase compensation of the comb excitation sensors, the single excitation of the rail head, rail web, and rail base detection modes is achieved over a wide frequency range. This study also establishes the modal singularity index, employing the higher-order elements SAFE method, and proposes a target modal selection rule for a wider frequency range. In addition, an evaluation index is defined to quantify the guided wave modal excitation effect is defined. Finite element simulations are used to investigate the influence of sensor spacing and number of sensor points on the array comb excitation effect, and suggestions are made for optimising the array comb excitation. Finally, experimental verification demonstrates the high accuracy of the higher-order elements SAFE method and confirms the effectiveness of the proposed comb excitation method.},

In this study, a reference-free damage detection method was developed by applying a deep long short-term memory network (DLSTM) to nonlinear ultrasonic modulation signals. First, an ultrasonic signal was generated and measured using piezoceramic ultrasonic transducers. Subsequently, a DLSTM network was constructed and trained to learn the inherent sequential patterns of the measured ultrasonic signals. Then, an absolute damage index (ADI) was defined and computed using only the current ultrasonic signal without any reference ultrasonic signal obtained from the intact condition. Finally, the crack was automatically detected using the ADI and without any user-specified threshold. The performance of the proposed method was examined using data from a submerged floating tunnel model and an actual long-span bridge. The results highlight the feasibility of the proposed method for automatic fatigue crack detection.},

	abstract = {Composite-overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV) are increasingly used in the transportation industry due to their high strength to mass ratio. Throughout the years, various designs were developed and found their applications. Currently, there are five designs, which can be subdivided into two main categories - with a load-sharing metal liner and with a non-load-sharing plastic liner. The main damage mechanism defining the lifetime of the first type is fatigue of the metal liner, whereas for the second type it is fatigue of the composite overwrap. Nevertheless, one damage type which may drastically reduce the lifetime of COPV is impact-induced damage. Therefore, this barely visible damage needs to be assessed in a non-destructive way to decide whether the pressure vessel can be further used or has to be put out of service. One of the possible methods is based on ultrasonic waves. In this contribution, both conventional ultrasonic testing (UT) by high-frequency bulk waves and wavenumber mapping by low frequency guided waves are used to evaluate impact damage. Wavenumber mapping techniques are first benchmarked on a simulated aluminium panel then applied to experimental measurements acquired on a delaminated aluminium-CFRP composite plate which corresponds to a structure of COPV with a load-sharing metal liner. The analysis of experimental data obtained from measurements of guided waves propagating in an aluminium-CFRP composite plate with impact-induced damage is performed. All approaches show similar performance in terms of quantification of damage size and depths while being applied to numerical data. The approaches used on the experimental data deliver an accurate estimate of the in-plane size of the large delamination at the aluminium-CFRP interface but only a rough estimate of its depth. Moreover, none of the wavenumber mapping techniques used in the study can quantify every delamination between CFRP plies caused by the impact, which is the case for conventional UT. This may be solved by using higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) or more advanced signal processing techniques. All in all, it can be concluded that imaging of complex impact damage in fibre-reinforced composites based on wavenumber mapping is not straightforward and stays a challenging task.},

The study shows that the presence of debonding between steel rebar and concrete surface produces breathing phenomenon causing contact acoustic nonlinearity (CAN), which generates second harmonics. Time-frequency analysis is used to estimate the location of debonding in this study. At a particular frequency, embedded rebar has much greater number of wave modes in bare rebar. To avoid unnecessary complexity, only longitudinal GW modes for bare and embedded rebar are excited and received to detect and locate debonding. To precisely determine the wave mode at excited frequency and frequency of second harmonics, frequency-wavenumber analysis is performed using 2D-Fast Fourier Transform of time-space data. Three-dimensional explicit finite element simulations are performed for various case studies and the model is validated by experimentally measured data. The results of this study show that the proposed method is practically viable and beneficial for debonding detection and location estimation in reinforced concrete structures.},

	abstract = {Utilization of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICCP) via biomineralization process has been considered a novel method in self healing of concrete structures. To develop MICCP as ready product for field scale construction, mineral based inoculum of higher shelf life is required. The present study focuses on this aspect of field based application of MICCP. In this study, mineral admixture (silica fume (SF), cement kiln dust (CKD) and rice husk ash (RHA)) based bacterial inoculum were developed to immobilize bacteria for self healing capabilities in concrete. The prepared inoculum was stored at varying temperature (4 °C and 25 °C) and the survival of bacterial cells in carrier based materials were tested on weekly basis until 180 days of storage at both temperature. After 180 days of storage, the most efficient bacterial inoculum based upon viability studies was incorporated in concrete and tested for crack healing performance. For this, crack of approximately 0.5 mm width was generated during the casting and healed using a bacteria-based healing agent (nutrient broth, urea and CaCl2). The healed cracked surface was examined through optical imaging to monitor the crack width reduction. Along with this, Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) technique was used to monitor the crack healing potential until the full healing of cracked surface was achieved. Statistical EMI indicators such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD) and correlation coefficient deviation (CCD) were employed to quantify crack healing process. RMSD was found to be promising parameter to monitor the crack healing process and reflected an increasing trend from 1 \% to 14 \% in healed bacterial specimen. At the end of test, the healed specimens were subjected to bending failure to assess the strength regain. Significant regain was noticed in healed bacterial specimen (approximately 33 \%) in comparison to the control. The healing mineral precipitated inside the cracks was examined through field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to evaluate its physicochemical attributes. The results give clear proof that the SF-based carrier material can be effectively used in healing the cracks and the crack healing process can be efficiently monitored by the EMI technique. Results further indicated that RMSD values were very effective in quantifying the progressive crack healing achieved due to MICCP precipitation.},

The test results show that for crack defects, the deepening of the defects will increase the ultrasonic nonlinear effect of the test piece. When the crack depth exceeds 4 mm, the non-linear effect of crack defects does not increase. For fatigue crack defects, the occurrence of crack defects will also exacerbate the nonlinear effect of the test piece, but when the test piece is fatigue fractured, its macro defects have a smaller effect on nonlinearity.},

However, conventional imaging techniques require relatively longer data acquisition time and large storage space. Reconstructing waves from sparse sampled images can potentially overcome such difficulties. In this regard, sparse sampling techniques based on random sampling and uniform sampling are explored in this paper. Specifically random sparse sampling using Poisson disk with biharmonic interpolation (PDS-BI) technique is shown to achieve defect identification with an image sparsity of 95\% and a sensor density of 5λ2. On the other hand, a novel technique based on uniform sparse sampling with carrier multiplication (US-CM) is demonstrated to reconstruct the image with a sparsity of greater than 98\% and a sensor density less than 2λ2. The performance of the proposed techniques has been quantified using Structural Similarity (SSIM) metric and validated through experiments. The reconstructed images are found to be in good agreement with those obtained by a dense array with much larger number of receivers. We also experimentally demonstrate the visualization of ultrasonic wave propagation in a metallic plate using a surface-bonded fiber Bragg grating sensor as an alternative to the conventional sensor.},

	abstract = {Damage detection of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) composites is a challenging issue owing to their intrinsic high degree of anisotropy with complex failure modes. Data-driven approaches have great potential in damage detection for CFRP composites. However, the lack of physical interpretability makes data-driven methods highly dependent on the amount of data, which involves significant effort in experiment and is impractical to obtain for all damage conditions. To overcome the above challenges, a robust and generalizable framework for damage detection of CFRP composite structures is proposed by fusing monitoring data with physical mechanisms. In this framework, the numerical method is leveraged to build physical models of the composite structures to generate data under various damage conditions. Then, a deep transfer learning-based model is applied in the fusion of experiment and simulation data, which mitigates the discrepancy between the physical model and real experiment. With the combination of domain adaptation and domain adversarial training in the model, the domain invariant features can be generalized from the source domain (simulation data) to the target domain (experiment data). Therefore, the physical interpretability is supplemented in the data-driven model. To verify the adaptability of the method, different transfer tasks based on the accelerated aging experiments are performed. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the dependence of the data-driven methods on real monitoring data and prevails in all evaluation indicators than other methods. Eventually, this method can reduce the experiment effort of damage detection for composites while holding a great detection accuracy.},

	abstract = {Soda-lime glass is widely used in many areas of daily life because of it is inexpensive, chemically stable, reasonably hard, extremely workable, and has excellent optical properties. In use, it is subject to weathering degradation. This causes surface changes that reduce its optical properties. After carrying out a spectral characterization of their effects, we highlight that the changes produced have a specific signature in the LWIR band due to the IR absorbing properties of the glass. Therefore, LWIR cameras used as radiometers are perfectly suited for their quantification by a non-contact measurement of their LWIR apparent emissivity. The LWIR apparent emissivity is provided in a quantitative thermographic approach. Based on the imaging capabilities of the thermal camera, it is possible to generate a 2D mapping of the surface changes in the form of an emissogram. The metrological capabilities of LWIR bolometric thermal cameras are then tested under laboratory conditions (strict control of influence temperatures) and under outdoor conditions. Under laboratory conditions, LWIR apparent emissivity is capable of quantifying specral anomalies as small as A=5\%μm. The indicator is suitable for managing the effects of erosion and hydration of glass, respectively from 8 \% of the eroded surface and from 100h of humid heat (2 years of natural exposure in a temperate climate). In outdoor conditions, the reflected temperature is an advantage because it improves the Type B accuracy of LWIR apparent emissivity measurements. Assuming a 3 °C non-uniformity of surface temperature, as it is the case for PV systems with active cooling, we conclude that erosion effects should be quantifiable from 48 \% of the eroded surface, allowing optical transmittance losses of glass to be detected from 10 \%. The effects of glass hydration remain difficult to manage due to the weakness of the spectral anomalies they produce.},

However, research gaps remain in effectively quantifying and understanding the uncertainties in super-resolution imaging. In this study, we present a Bayesian deep learning approach to quantify and interpret various uncertainties in super-resolution guided wave array imaging. Specifically, we implement a Monte Carlo (MC) dropout scheme in the multi-scale deep learning models for approximate Bayesian inference to effectively quantify uncertainties in super-resolution subwavelength defect imaging. Furthermore, we decompose the total predictive uncertainty into distinct uncertainty sources: aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the data and epistemic uncertainty associated with the Bayesian deep learning model. From the experimental study, we observe that the two types of uncertainty (aleatoric and epistemic) in super-resolution guided wave array imaging can be successfully quantified using the multi-scale Bayesian deep learning approach. We further discuss the effectiveness of the Bayesian deep learning approach in small-data cases and compare the super-resolution imaging performance with a non-Bayesian (deterministic) deep learning approach.},

The frequency stability of cavity resonance peaks for fabricated 2-port SAW resonators of different cavity length are measured and analyzed to determine the cavity length which exhibits maximum frequency stability. A cross-correlation analysis technique is then introduced to improve the detection of the frequency shift of SAW resonances and enable multimode frequency shift detection. The measured frequency sensitivity to strain of the cavity resonances of a resonator 10 mm in length (operating frequency = 97.7 MHz) was found to be − 103.2 ± 0.2 Hz/με while demonstrating excellent linearity (R2 = 0.9999).

However, there are two challenges for robust localization of defects: frequency sensitivity to defects, and multi-mode interference on damage index (DI) extraction. Aiming for that, a wideband dispersion reversal (WDR) method optimized tomography is developed. Pre-dispersive wideband excitations of a certain Lamb wave mode are generated based on the configuration of transducers, and reconstruction independent component analysis is used for wave mode separation. According to the acoustic reciprocity principle, self-compensation phenomenon of mode signals can be recorded on the intact path, where the signal energy concentrates at a fix self-compensation point in the time–frequency domain, yet such compensation effect would be impaired encountering defects. Thus, a time–frequency index can be used as the DI, which is calculated based on the weighted Euclidean distance from the self-compensation point to the pixel points in the time–frequency domain. Experimental results show the WDR optimized tomography has a robust performance for magnet-simulated defects imaging without excitation frequency optimization.},

A new non-bonded sensor configuration, specially adapted for small diameter pipelines, known as modified non-bonded sensor (MNS), is proposed and evaluated. The new sensor configuration is evaluated for sensitivity in monitoring corrosion induced damage in pipeline segments in controlled laboratory setup through accelerated corrosion tests. The conventional surface-bonded piezo-sensor (SBPS) configuration is used as standard for comparison. Signature analysis using different methods is carried out in the study. Using the principles of the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique, equivalent stiffness, damping and mass parameters are computed from the admittance signatures of both the configurations (MNS \& SBPS) and compared. Experimental results show that piezo based a non-dimensional mass parameter from the MNS measurements are very effective in damage detection and quantification. The results are correlated with actual mass loss measurements and consequent corrosion rates are calibrated. The results clearly make case for practical usage of MNS configuration in corrosion detection and health monitoring of pipeline systems.

Owing to dispersion, multi-mode, and strong background noises, the defect signal can generally be overwhelmed. To solve this problem, a new sparse-based defect detection method is proposed for weld feature guided waves with a fusion of shear wave characteristics. First, an over-complete dictionary is established combining wavenumber and scattering characteristics of shear wave. Then, the split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm is introduced in the basis pursuit algorithm for the sparse solution. The defect features of the signal can be sparsely extracted. The effectiveness is evaluated via simulation studies and further verified through the practical experiment data. Compared with the wavelet atom method, the location error of the proposed method reduces by about 1.0\% to only 0.564\% in simulation and about 2.0\% to only 0.671\% in practical experiment.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonics guided waves (GWs) are established as an effective structural health monitoring technique for detecting damage in composite structures. However, for GWs to be applied reliably in service, the effect of temperature needs to be accounted for baseline damage detection approaches. Previous studies have focused on developing temperature compensation methods for surface-mounted transducers. In this paper, an extensive investigation has been carried out to develop an effective temperature compensation method for GWs generated by embedded transducers in different thickness composites. To accomplish this, Laser Doppler Vibrometer experiments were carried out to obtain wavenumbers generated by embedded transducers and to compare them against surface mounted cases. The consistent trend observation of dispersion curves between surface-mounted and embedded PZTs serves as a foundation for conducting analysis of the embedded signals with the effect of temperature. Following that, GW propagation has been studied in three quasi-isotropic composites of 2 mm, 4 mm and 9 mm thicknesses. Based on the established temperature database with measurements from − 50 °C to 70 °C, a temperature compensation methodology has been developed and validated with the temperature difference of 30 °C. It demonstrates that the temperature effect on the embedded PZTs is lower in comparison to surface mounted PZTs, and the temperature compensation of a single thickness composite is scalable to other panels thickness. This novel methodology proves beneficial in reducing the scale of the experimental campaign required, which holds significant value for actual aeronautical structures characterized by variable composite thicknesses across different sections, such as in fuselage panels or wing boxes.},

The paper proposes a novel elastic wave propagation method for damage detection based on the reconstruction of the shape of the reflected wavefront. The main advantage of the developed approach is that merely three sensors are necessary to localize and estimate the size of the cracks with various sizes and shapes.

Of many nondestructive testing techniques, laser ultrasonic testing is a non-contact method that yields accurate inspection results with high spatial resolution; this method was adopted in this study for the inspection of thick composite structures. We propose a novel guided-wave ultrasonic propagation imaging (UPI) method, called the reverberation wave UPI (R-wave UPI), which is capable of faster target scanning and clearer highlighting of confining waves. To prove the merits of the R-wave UPI, a relatively thin carbon/epoxy composite (thickness, 12 mm) was first tested using the proposed method and the conventional through-transmission UPI. The R-wave UPI modifies the guided-wave UPI with a faster pulse repetition frequency (PRF) laser and ultrasonic energy mapping with straightforward parameter determination. The through-transmission UPI consisting of a raster mechanical scanner, a Q-switched laser, and a laser Doppler vibrometer, was used as a reference, whereas the R-wave UPI consisting of an angular laser mirror scanner, a Q-switched laser, and a PZT sensor was operated at a high PRF in the kilohertz regime to induce reverberation. The reverberation phenomenon was used in the post-image processing, called ultrasonic energy mapping (UEM). UEM with a high PRF was then compared to the through-transmission inspection reference to verify its accuracy and reliability for mapping of structural anomalies. Finally, a thick and curved composite blade with a rough and curved surface that could not be inspected using the conventional through-transmission UPI was tested using 7 kHz PRF and its delamination was successfully visualized using the UEM.},

This strategy has been validated by two types of composite sandwich panels: one is honeycomb sandwich structures with CFRP composite laminate skins; the other is balsa sandwich with GFRP skins. It is demonstrated that acoustic wave velocity in the sandwich is dominated by the skin property, namely the elastic modulus of the skin, the density of the constituents, the core and skin thickness. Moreover, only by measuring the velocity in one direction, the velocity in any direction of composite structures can be predicted accurately and quickly.

	abstract = {Structural cables are important load-bearing members in many light-weight and slender structures. The mechanical behaviour of tension cables is complex as it is dominated by geometric nonlinearities, complex support conditions and uncertainties arising from the composition of the cable cross section. Numerous models to describe static and dynamic cable behaviour were developed, differing in the model assumptions and the simplifications made. Most common are geometrical linearisation, dimensional reduction, and the disregard of localised support and stiffness effects. Some models take a combination of some geometric nonlinearities, cable bending stiffness and certain boundary effects into account. This paper first presents a literature review aimed at systematically categorising cable force identification models. Based on this, the paper proposes a novel numerical cable modelling framework that allows for accurate predictions of static and dynamic cable response, e.g. for the use in the inverse system identification techniques of Structural Health Monitoring. The saddled cable model is based on a nonlinear Finite Element formulation to account for the geometric and mechanical effects of deviating supports on structural cables even for very large sag cables. After validation with analytical solutions, the models show that the effect of self-weight distribution and cable bending stiffness considerably affects the identified internal force distribution, contact length on the saddle and cable form. Further, the model is used to predict the tension force based on the identified natural frequencies of an external tendon installed on a bridge. Compared with the actual tension force, the saddled cable model provided very high prediction accuracy, even when compared with other cable models. Therefore, it is shown to be very accurate and can be used to determine force-response relationships used in system identification techniques when increased accuracy is needed for such complex cable arrangements.},

However, its effectiveness in segmenting thermal images remains under-explored. The main challenge lies in the development of specific models and the generation of a large range of labeled infrared images for training. To address this challenge, a customized deep learning model based on encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to segment the delaminated areas in thermal images at the pixel level. Data augmentation strategies were implemented in creating the training data set to improve the performance of the proposed model. The deep learning generated model was deployed in a real-world project to further evaluate the model's applicability and robustness. The results of these experimental studies supported the effectiveness of the deep learning model in segmenting concrete delamination areas from infrared images. It also suggested that data augmentation is a helpful technique to address the small size issue of training samples. The field test with validation further demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed framework. Limitations of the proposed approach were also briefed at the end of the paper.},

	abstract = {Structural damage identification plays a crucial role in structural health monitoring. In this study, a novelty method for structural damage identification is developed, which employs an advanced surrogate modelling technique to drive a new hybrid optimization strategy, namely a combination of K-means clustering optimizer and genetic algorithm (HKOGA). The core of this method is using the reliable sparse polynomial chaos expansion model as a cost-effective substitute for the computationally expensive structural finite element models, thus greatly improving the efficiency of the optimization strategy in finding the optimal value of the objective function. To evaluate the performance of this hybrid optimization strategy, seven optimization algorithms are selected and compared with it for 23 classical benchmark functions, and the comparative results show that the HKOGA has the best performance. Taking a small-scaled laboratory dam as an example, the efficiency and reliability of the proposed method to cope with the problems concerning finite element model updating and structural damage identification are explored. Two important findings are as follows. (i) For finite element model updating, compared to the conventional method based on iterative optimization, the proposed method improves computational efficiency by a factor of 59 while maintaining computational accuracy. (ii) For structural damage identification, leaving aside the huge leap in computational efficiency, the HKOGA has a faster convergence rate, stronger robustness, and higher accuracy than its sub-algorithm K-means clustering optimizer (KO). The results show that this method can be severed as an extremely efficient and potential tool to identify damage in large and complex structures.},

	abstract = {For large-scale structure inspection, the traditional ultrasonic inspection methods are time-consuming and inefficient. Recently, many approaches based on ultrasonic guided waves have been developed. However, during the propagation of guided waves, as the propagation distance increases, the signal amplitude attenuates gradually, as a result, the reflected wave packets from the incipient defects are always seriously contaminated or even buried in noise, and the defect signatures cannot be effectively identified in this circumstance. To detect incipient defect as early as possible to ensure structure safety, it is very essential to suppress the background noise and enhance the reflected wave packet from defect. To address this issue, a physics-informed deep filtering method is proposed for ultrasonic guided waves enhancement. In the proposed method, a deep learning model is constructed and trained based on template signals of ultrasonic guided waves simulated by digital model with different parameters, and then generalized to enhancement of weak ultrasonic guided waves from practical cases. The simulation test and experimental results on large-scale square tube structures indicate that the proposed ultrasonic guided waves enhancement method is effective for early-stage defect inspection and outperforms the traditional guided waves enhancement approaches.},

Using combined frequency waves originated due to contact nonlinearity when the incident dual frequency wave interacts with the damage, a damage localization imaging algorithm is proposed to locate the damage and determine the damage location. The proposed damage localization imaging algorithm is based on analysing the cross-correlation of the signal envelope at combined frequency wave with the excitation pulse envelope at incident waves for each transducer pair, the damage localization image is constructed. A numerical study using an experimentally validated finite element model is used to verify the proposed damage detection technique. The results of the numerical study show that, despite the small amplitude of the nonlinear components, the proposed method can effectively predict the damage location, and it does not require baseline measurements, which makes it potential to be a baseline-free damage detection technique.},

The scattering behaviour is represented by first-order approximations of the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated with a perturbation approach, both at the fundamental frequency and at the generated third harmonic. Due to its nonlinearity and spatial asymmetry, such a system behaves in general nonreciprocally. By analyzing the fundamental-frequency and third-harmonic transmission coefficients, we derive conditions for particular scattering behaviours that result in transmission symmetry for the nonlinear system. We show that a sufficient condition for symmetric fundamental-frequency transmission is that the spacing between the scatterers is a multiple of half the incident wavelength, regardless of the scatterers’ properties, although the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients will still depend on the incident-wave amplitude. Such a response is also possible if the real and imaginary parts of the admittance of the linear scatterer satisfy a certain mathematical relation, regardless of spacing. A particular choice of lossless linear scatterer combined with the separation distance being a multiple of half a wavelength leads to fully linear behaviour for the nonlinear multiple scattering system.},

The cumulative standing-wave energy (CSWE) method that uses a traveling wave is implemented to verify the feasibility of the ultrasound microphone. The excitation energy of the pulsed laser was insufficient compared with that of the continuous-wave contact actuator. Therefore, a modified local wavenumber estimation (LWE) method is proposed, which reconstructs several LWE images at various frequencies. These images are averaged to calculate thicknesses of the plate and defects, by using the wavenumber–thickness relationship. The method has an error of 2.84\% and 7.7\% for the thickness of the plate and defect area, respectively.},

	abstract = {Acoustic emission (AE) for structural health monitoring of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) has been under extensive study in past decades. Many of the available methods rely on using the conventional features of AE signals for clustering. These clusters are then related to a specific failure mechanism based on their behaviors. The conventional AE features are derived from a portion of the signal waveform that passes through a pre-determined threshold and is heavily affected by attenuation. Therefore, recent studies on AE are more focused on waveform analysis. A key parameter when analyzing the waveform distribution is the selection of appropriate bin width. This study discusses the choice of an optimum bin width for waveform analysis. This parameter is then shown to be well correlated to the conventional threshold-dependent features of AE signals. The bin width is then used as a time-domain representation of the waveform and is used with the peak frequency for signal clustering. A series of tensile tests are performed on cross-ply and quasi-isotropic open-hole carbon FRP (CFRP) specimens. The results show that AE signal clustering using these features outperform clustering performance using conventional AE features. This approach is shown to divide signals into two clusters; a cluster with matrix dominated signals and a cluster with fiber dominated signals. The information entropy of signals in each cluster is evaluated and compared to the information entropy of noise signals.},

Compared to traditional VAM, we replaced the shaker through the PZT transducer, and both low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) excitations were based on linear swept sine waves. Then, a new entropy-based damage index (DI) using the multiscale permutation entropy (MPE) was developed to characterize the crack width. According to experimental results, there was a one-to-one relationship between the DI and the crack width, particularly, without saturation. Therefore, we demonstrated the capacity of the new VAM method to monitor crack propagation process, which can guide future investigations.},

	abstract = {Due to its high efficiency, carbon fibre reinforced composite materials are used in many applications, including aeronautical, automotive, and civil structures. A wide range of manufacturing processes are used in composites production and each of these processes is marked by many processing parameters. However, because of the variations that are inherent to the manufacturing method, the final properties of the structure can be strongly affected, mainly the strength values. On the other hand, Vibration-Based Methods (VBM) has the advantage of simplicity and low cost, although it is very sensitive to variations in geometry and material properties. Therefore, it is strategic to deepen the research in this line to generalize the method, allowing its use in the industry as a solution to complicated real-life problems. Thus, this work presents a new numerical-experimental methodology to evaluate the effect of design parameter variations on the dynamic response of laminated composite cylinders. Numerical dynamic analyses are run via a Finite Element code, which is complemented with subroutines written in Python. A Design of Experiments (DoE) strategy is developed to reduce the number of experiments and to evaluate the effect of the design parameter variations. Three sets of nominally different composite cylinders are investigated [(90/60/-60)2/90]s, [(90/30/-30)2/90]s and [90/30/-60/60/-60/30/-30]s. System natural frequencies as taken as the primary response quantities. Frequency Response Functions (FRF) enrich the data set for more elaborate analysis. A DoE strategy is set up to deal with the range of design parameters and process parameters, a full factorial design is selected. Afterward, the results are discussed with proper attention for the potential and limitations of the proposed methodology from the perspective of usage to detect defects in real laminated composite cylinders. Finally, damage indices are calculated using the experimental FRFs magnitudes to quantify the influence of the undamaged and impact damage structure. The general conclusion is that the new methodology provides the foundations for the next generation of software systems for detecting defects from the manufacturing process and damage caused in-service of real composite structures.},

To detect damage, a 2D wavelet transform with various scale components is applied to track any changes in wavenumber and a mapping process based on local wavenumber filtering is carried out. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique, several experiments are conducted on composite and aluminum structures, which contain various types of hidden damage, including Teflon inserts and machined thinning.

	abstract = {Timely and effective health evaluation of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures under dynamic fatigue loading is one of the key issues of CFRP in practical engineering applications. This paper uses a combination of acoustic emission (AE) and digital image correlation (DIC) to study the fatigue behavior of CFRP open-hole laminated beams with different stacking sequences under pure tensile loading, and analyze the influence of different damage mechanisms on the ultimate fatigue failure of the specimens. Two parameters, AE hit rate and absolute AE energy, are used to characterize the stiffness degradation behavior of CFRP structures. The strain field distribution characteristics during the damage failure of specimens with different stacking sequences are discussed in association with DIC. Based on the data obtained by AE and DIC, the damage modes of two types of layered CFRP laminated beams are identified by combining principal component analysis (PCA) and the K-means++ algorithm. The clustering results are consistent with the microscopic image results of the fracture surface. The identified modes are employed to characterize the dynamic evolution of fatigue damage in CFRP, and the contribution of different damage modes to the ultimate fatigue failure of the specimens is analyzed using cumulative damage index (CDI) values.},

	abstract = {Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) structures may experience cumulative fatigue damage during their service life which can lead to structural failure. This paper focuses on predicting the residual fatigue life of FRP structures using vibration parameters. The relationship between residual fatigue life and natural frequencies is examined through modal testing and fatigue measurements on FRP beam specimens. Two prediction methods; semi-empirical models and machine learning (ML) algorithms, are utilized. The semi-empirical models are derived from existing “residual stiffness” models based on the relationship between bending stiffness and flexural frequencies. ML algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are developed for fatigue life prediction. Experimental validation is performed using measured frequencies during fatigue testing of FRP beams. The ML algorithms can use multimode frequencies unlike single mode of semi-empirical models. The verification results show that the ML algorithms can be used to predict the residual fatigue life with the selection of the appropriate mode of frequency. The results show that ML algorithms outperform single-mode frequency inputs, and the use of higher modes of measured frequencies improves the precision of fatigue life prediction. An inverse algorithm based on SVM exhibits higher prediction accuracy and stability, even with limited training samples.},

Firstly, the CFDC based on the fusion of FRFs at multiple measuring positions of cylinders is constructed to characterize the delamination. Subsequently, the normalized CFDC is used as the input of a CNN model, so as to predict the circumferential angle and axial distance of delamination in cylinders. Moreover, the linear model between the complex frequency domain correlation indicator (CFDCI) and the delamination area is established due to the high linearity between them. Finally, the area of delamination is predicted based on the linear model, whose coefficients are predicted by another CNN model. The proposed method performs well in localization and area evaluation of delamination with high accuracy in the numerical cases. The delamination in each experimental case is identified within certain error even with serious noise in measurement. In addition, the comparison with other common methods indicates higher accuracy of the proposed method in delamination identification for CFRP cylinders.},

	abstract = {A health indicator (HI) is a valuable index demonstrating the health level of an engineering system or structure, which is a direct intermediate connection between raw signals collected by structural health monitoring (SHM) methods and prognostic models for remaining useful life estimation. An appropriate HI should conform to prognostic criteria, i.e., monotonicity, trendability, and prognosability, that are commonly utilized to measure the HI’s quality. However, constructing such a HI is challenging, particularly for composite structures due to their vulnerability to complex damage scenarios. Data-driven models and deep learning are powerful mathematical tools that can be employed to achieve this purpose. Yet the availability of a large dataset with labels plays a crucial role in these fields, and the data collected by SHM methods can only be labeled after the structure fails. In this respect, semi-supervised learning can incorporate unlabeled data monitored from structures that have not yet failed. In the present work, a semi-supervised deep neural network is proposed to construct HI by SHM data fusion. For the first time, the prognostic criteria are used as targets of the network rather than employing them only as a measurement tool of HI’s quality. In this regard, the acoustic emission method was used to monitor composite panels during fatigue loading, and extracted features were used to construct an intelligent HI. Finally, the proposed roadmap is evaluated by the holdout method, which shows a 77.3\% improvement in the HI’s quality, and the leave-one-out cross-validation method, which indicates the generalized model has at least an 81.77\% score on the prognostic criteria. This study demonstrates that even when the true HI labels are unknown but the qualified HI pattern (according to the prognostic criteria) can be recognized, a model can still be built that provides HIs aligning with the desired degradation behavior.},

The rough outer layer of the produced ductile iron pipes leads to considerable background noise, limiting the probability of detection of laser ultrasonic testing equipment. In this study, an improved variational mode decomposition approach based on particle swarm optimization is suggested initially to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This technique develops a fitness function suitable for processing ultrasound signals. A scanning laser ultrasound technique is designed for simultaneous measuring wall thickness and finding slag inclusions in ductile iron pipes based on excitation locations and flight time. A finite element analysis simulation model is established to assess the feasibility of this scanning method. This experiment is conducted on a 4.2 mm thick sample with slag inclusion defects and a 6.2 mm thick sample without slag inclusion flaws. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed denoising technique may enhance the average signal-to-noise ratio from 34.83 dB to 43.15 dB; the accuracies of thicknesses measurement for two ductile iron pipes are 96.90\% and 99.52\%, respectively, and the slag inclusion defects can be recognized by ultrasonic amplitude or energy distribution in different B-scan images.

This article presents a study of the feasibility of piezoelectric diaphragms as an alternative transducer, allowing to expand the research as well as to accelerate the implementation of Lamb wave-based SHM systems with lower installation costs. Piezoelectric diaphragms are sound components widely used in everyday electronic devices and, in addition to the low cost, they have the advantage of being mass-produced by different manufacturers in standard sizes and are readily available. To assess the feasibility of these components, basic analysis by finite element method (FEM) and experimental tests were carried out on aluminum plates and the results obtained with the diaphragms were compared with those obtained using conventional piezoelectric ceramics. Structural damage was simulated by making cracks and drilling holes in the structure and an imaging algorithm together with damage index based on the wavelet transform was used to detect and locate damage. In addition, tests were carried out to evaluate and compare the reproducibility of the results and the effects of temperature variation on the two types of transducers. FEM and experimental results show that piezoelectric diaphragms are feasible for generating and receiving Lamb waves, as well as detecting structural damage. Therefore, these commercial sound components can also be alternative transducers for applications involving Lamb waves.},

A damage localization algorithm was designed according to the resistance characteristics obtained by the theoretical calculation and simulation. A relationship between CFRPs thickness and the electrical resistance was built, and damage modes were analyzed with assistance of computed tomography observations. Results show that the electric resistance changes between electrode networks could be used to help imaging the damage positions with a very high accuracy (6\% error).

	abstract = {In this paper, time reversal with multiple signal classification (TR-MUSIC) and its phase-coherent form (PC-MUSIC), the two typical ultrasonic time-reversal-based super resolution imaging techniques, have been introduced and explored to image defects in metallic samples. The principles for super resolution imaging technique and defect characterization based on ultrasonic image have been presented firstly. And then both TR-MUSIC and PC-MUSIC are tested with experimental ultrasonic array data acquired from the metallic samples including defects using the full matrix capture (FMC) process. Here, if the size of defect is smaller than the central ultrasonic wavelength, the defect can be regarded as point-like target. On the contrary, if the size of defect is larger than the central ultrasonic wavelength, it can be regarded as extended target. The comparison on super resolution imaging for point-like and extended targets has been investigated. For point-like targets, TR-MUSIC as well as PC-MUSIC can distinguish and locate the position, and the overall performance of TR-MUSIC is better than that of PC-MUSIC. For extended target, TR-MUSIC can only determine the area where the defect occurs. PC-MUSIC can distinguish and assess the length of extended target parallel to the array, the lowest error is 9.62\% when the dimension of signal subspace is set to be 10 for the case considered. In addition, the defect characterization based on ultrasonic super-resolved image has been studied, and a sizing strategy is introduced. The length and angle of extended targets oblique to the array can be obtained from the PC-MUSIC images. The worst errors for assessing the length and angel are 9.14\% and 13.3\% respectively. And for the cases considered in the experiment, the longer the length of extended target, the smaller the error.},

	abstract = {Quantitative prediction of guided wave fields (GW) radiated by ultrasonic sources in parts is a generic problem whose solutions are important in many applications of quantitative non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM). NDE and SHM methods relying on GW are very challenging to optimize due to the complexity of GW propagation. This is all the more difficult since composite materials are concerned and since the finite size of the piece cannot be ignored. A simulation tool for choosing the most appropriate transducer in a given application, for optimally positioning transducers by considering the actual testing configuration etc., would be most valuable to practitioners. In order to develop such a tool, a semi-analytical model is derived to predict the modal radiation by an arbitrary source of surface stress of guided waves in a finite anisotropic plate. Considering arbitrary source of surface stress allows us to cover most ultrasonic sources. Considering composite plates of finite size allows us to deal with configurations of industrial interest involving complex wavepaths from the source to field points. Considering modal solutions allows one to more easily interpret complex waveforms. This model combines and generalizes an approximate model predicting the modal Green's function for GW in an infinite anisotropic plate and an approximate model predicting the modal Green's function for GW in a finite isotropic plate. It is validated by comparing its predictions to those computed by a time-domain finite element code for elastodynamics.},

However, the current technique based on Lamb waves has limitations regarding accuracy and quality of imaging. To address this issue, an improved bilateral boundary-enhanced reconstruction algorithm for the probabilistic inspection of defects (BBERAPID) is proposed. This algorithm optimizes the probability distribution near the damage boundary to enhance the accuracy of damage imaging. The skewed bilateral boundary distribution algorithm can improve the probability distribution of edges on both sides of the damage and alleviate the problem of abnormal boundary expansion. In addition, a new damage index (DI) calculation method is proposed to accelerate the DI trend near the damage. The new DI can improve the fineness of the damage boundary, thus better distinguish the healthy area from the damage area. Traditional DI has the problem of abnormal distribution at the damage boundary, which BBERAPID solves. The probability distribution near the damage is optimized to improve the quality and accuracy of damage imaging. Experimental studies are performed using composite plates to validate the proposed method further. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed BBERAPID algorithm for detecting damages in composite plates are verified by comparing it with existing imaging methods through experimental validation.

However, many possibilities are still unexplored given by the multitude of possible microwave waveguides. The present work introduces the concept of microwave leakage monitoring to detect stringer debondings in hollow carbon composite structures. The principle is to monitor the wave propagation characteristics within the cavity formed by the stringer and the airframe skin using transmission measurements. Changes in the transmission path, e.g. occurring from microwave leakage in the debonded region, can be assessed through a damage indicator approach. To proof this concept, an experimental campaign was carried out according to the building block approach typically used in aeronautics. First, a small-scale specimen with a debonded stringer was investigated in the laboratory. Then, a large-scale fuselage structure was used for technology demonstration enabling stringer debonding with increasing severity through static and fatigue loading. The paper shows that the microwave characteristics in the waveguide (stringer tunnel) is affected by the debonding conditions according to its severity and depth. This allows designing a structural health monitoring system based on guided electromagnetic waves trapped in the tunnel.},

	abstract = {Applications of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) combined with Machine Learning (ML) techniques enhance real-time performance tracking and increase structural integrity awareness of civil, aerospace and automotive infrastructures. This SHM-ML synergy has gained popularity in the last years thanks to the anticipation of maintenance provided by arising ML algorithms and their ability of handling large quantities of data and considering their influence in the problem. In this paper we develop a novel ML nearest-neighbors-alike algorithm based on the principle of maximum entropy to predict fatigue damage (Palmgren–Miner index) in composite materials by processing the signals of Lamb Waves – a non-destructive SHM technique – with other meaningful features such as layup parameters and stiffness matrices calculated from the Classical Laminate Theory (CLT). The full data analysis cycle is applied to a dataset of delamination experiments in composites. The predictions achieve a good level of accuracy, similar to other ML algorithms, e.g. Neural Networks or Gradient-Boosted Trees, and computation times are of the same order of magnitude. The key advantages of our proposal are: (1) The automatic determination of all the parameters involved in the prediction, so no hyperparameters have to be set beforehand, which saves time devoted to hypertuning the model and also represents an advantage for autonomous, self-supervised SHM. (2) No training is required, which, in an online learning context where streams of data are fed continuously to the model, avoids repeated training—essential for reliable real-time, continuous monitoring.},

	abstract = {To control the propagation of multi-mode guided waves in plate is very significant in nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring for identifying damage and detecting structural integrity. In this paper, a novel metasurface is proposed to simultaneously manipulate multi-mode guided waves in plate, including shear horizontal wave, symmetric mode and anti-symmetric mode Lamb waves. For controlling the guided wave propagation in plate, the functional unit is designed by a staggered arrangement of in-plane polarized and out-of-plane polarized piezoelectric patches attached on both surfaces of host plate to form a metasurface, and each piezoelectric patch is individually connected with negative capacitance circuit. The transmitted phase of each mode guided wave through the functional unit can be shifted arbitrarily in 0∼2π range by adjusting the shunting negative capacitance circuits. Furthermore, the transmitted phase shifts profile along the metasurface can be coded to control the wave front of multi-mode guided waves in plate, and tunable functions including anomalous refraction and wave focusing can be realized. Results indicate that the proposed metasurface can simultaneously modulate and control the wave front of each mode guided wave to achieve wave mode splitting and purifying from multi-mode incident waves. In addition, a wave source shifter is realized by an annularly arranged metasurface to achieve equivalent wave source control. Therefore, the proposed piezoelectric metasurface has great potential in the fields of tunable manipulation of guided waves and design of smart devices.},

In the proposed algorithm, besides the signal amplitude used in the classical TFM, the waveform correlation coefficients between any two waveforms after dispersion compensation are also utilized for damage imaging. Waveform correlation coefficients will be large if the wave packets are caused by the same imaging point, or they will be small due to the change in waveform shape arising from dispersion. For each imaging point, dispersion compensation for all collected signals is respectively implemented so that the scattering waveforms can be extracted. Then the waveform correlation coefficients between any two scattering waveforms are calculated and weighted on the corresponding amplitude used in the TFM. By comparing the imaging results of the proposed algorithm with that of the classical TFM algorithm, it is found that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the background noise and thus improve the imaging performance.},

Using time–frequency image transformation, feature conditioning and a fast deep learning-based classifier, this method performed better in terms of speed, accuracy and robustness compared to other image classifiers. The performance of SpeedyNet was compared to that of two popular pre-trained CNN models, Xception and GoogleNet, and the results demonstrated that SpeedyNet was superior in both classification accuracy and computational speed.

The damage and thickness of the PVC pipe cap were monitored by designing the reflection geometry of the terahertz scanner based on optical components, such as beam splitter and focal lens. Additionally, the PVC pipe cap was controlled with a six-DOF robot arm for path planning. The corresponding predicted value for the thickness of the sample was computed as a function of at least one wall thickness parameter of the pipe that uses a captured terahertz wave because these waves are partially reflected when the medium is changed. The defects were simulated using a PVC pipe cap (inner diameter: 89 mm, outer diameter: 100 mm), and the specimen was mounted on a six-DOF robot arm to inspect the entire area of the PVC pipe cap. The reflected signals were analyzed to determine the thickness, defectiveness, and locations of the defects through signal processing in the time and frequency domains. Consequently, we can detect and visualize the various types of defects that are simulated in a PVC pipe cap.

	abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the use of ultrasonic guided wave (GW) propagation mechanism and the assessment of debonding in a sandwich composite structure (SCS) using a multi-step approach. Towards this, a series of GW propagation-based laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out on the SCS sample. The debonding regions of variable size and locations were assessed using a pre-defined network of piezoelectric lead zirconate transducers (PZT). Besides, several artificial masses were also placed in the SCS to validate the multi-step structural health monitoring (SHM) strategy. The SHM approach uses a proposed quick damage identification matrix maps and an improved elliptical wave processing (EWP) strategy of the registered GW signals to detect the locations of debonding and other damages in the SCS. The benefit of the proposed damage identification map is to locate the damaged area (sectors) quickly. This identification step is followed by applying the damage localization step using the improved EWP only on the previously identified damage sector region. The proposed EWP has shown the potential to effectively locate the hidden multiple debonding regions and damages in the SCS with a reduced number of calculations using a step-wise approach that uses only a selected number of grid points. The paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on data gathered from numerical simulations and experimental studies. Thus, using the above-mentioned SHM strategy debondings and damages present within and outside the sensor network are localized. The results were cross verified with nondestructive testing (NDT) methods such as infrared thermography and laser Doppler vibrometry.},

Further, the proposed framework is validated by comparison with the classical statistical approach and mass measurements, considering previous experimental work results. Notably, the impact of the number of measuring points is investigated, and the accuracy index is proposed to identify the optimum number of measurements. The developed framework has a significant advantage over the classical approach since measuring uncertainty is incorporated. Additionally, the confidence intervals of both mean value corrosion depth and standard deviation could be gathered due to the probabilistic character of the framework.

The Magnetic Force Induced Vibration Evaluation (M5) method is designed to reduce damping (one of the biggest problems of currently known modal analysis methods) and enables evaluating elements inaccessible to traditional methods. The method's concept is to directly induce rebars' vibrations (not a whole structure), measure them, and analyze the frequency spectrum changes. Past studies have already proved that vibrational characteristics are susceptible to a structure debonding. The novelty of the method is related to excitation and detection of vibrations in the tested elements. The M5 method is presented against the background of other nondestructive methods used currently in building diagnostics. The comparison contains the classification and review of these methods. Two versions of the excitation subsystems were proposed and tested. In both cases, the excited vibrations, which are the reaction of reinforcing bars to an alternating magnetic field, are measured using a magnetically coupled accelerometer. With such solutions, the proposed method is fully non-contact and allows for achieving high sensitivity and repeatability. The usefulness of the method was demonstrated by measuring several concrete test specimens with simulated debonding and real samples collected from the dismantled element of the bridge slab.},

	abstract = {To ensure the structural integrity of large aerospace structures during operation, structural health monitoring is a major challenge. The monitoring can be performed by distributed strain measurements using strain gauges or fiber optical sensors. In this work, an advanced local residual classifier for strain-based damage detection and localization is introduced. The key principle is that a change in the relationship between a strain sensor and its neighbors indicates the presence of damage. After defining a sensor grid with sensor locations and their orientation, the relationship can be obtained from numerical simulations of the healthy structure. Here, local regression models are estimated between each master sensor and its neighboring sensors. Then, residuals of the predicted and measured strains are evaluated using a random forest classifier. The evaluation of the residuals has the advantage that the method is independent of the load level, as well as the fact that it is independent of certain environmental influences that are uniformly distributed over the entire structure. In addition to the numerical healthy strains, synthetically generated damage data are used for training the classifier. The synthetic data are obtained by statistical modifications of the healthy strains. This procedure avoids time-consuming and expensive damage simulations. The health monitoring approach is applied to a glass fiber reinforced polymer sandwich structure, imitating an aircraft spoiler, with a hole in the face layer considered as damage. The validation is performed by numerical finite element simulations as well as physical experiments under random loading conditions. The results demonstrate the high potential of the presented approach for strain-based structural health monitoring in composite sandwich structures.},

The signals registered by a specially designed sensor network are processed to assess the state of the tested structure. Despite the constant development of novel damage detection algorithms employing guided waves, the phenomenon of wave propagation still needs detailed recognizing and understanding for the further progress of non-destructive wave-based methods. Special attention is paid to guided waves in plate-like structures, but the majority of considered cases concern plates with constant thickness. However, in the real world, we often deal with specimens with variable thickness. The thickness variability of the specimen is often forced to fulfill the construction requirements and optimize stress distribution or is the result of degradation i.e. corrosion. Thus, the development of NDT methods forces the need of considering specimens with complex geometry and the problem of wave propagation in waveguides with variable thickness is crucial for improving novel as well as so far proposed algorithms. The article presents the results of the analytical, numerical and experimental analysis of wave propagation in plates with variable thickness. The analysis concerns the influence of thickness distribution of plate structure on wave velocity, the time course wave packet and amplitude. Moreover, the novel approach based on constrained convex optimization for determining the plate thickness distribution has been proposed and verified during numerical and experimental campaigns.},

	abstract = {Guided waves, especially Lamb waves, propagating in plate-like structures with constant thicknesses have been investigated intensively in the past decades in the context of structural health monitoring (SHM) and non-destructive testing (NDT). However, structures with variable thicknesses are also very common in practice, such as ship hulls whose thickness varies for satisfying various load conditions, and defect identification for such structures is also of importance. In this paper, we compare the propagation characteristics of both Lamb modes and SH0 mode in variable thickness plates and propose to use the SH0 mode for defect identification in such waveguides because of its non-dispersive property. First, the non-dispersive property of the SH0 mode in waveguides with variable thickness is demonstrated in theory. Then, a wave prediction method is adopted to illustrate the differences between the Lamb modes and the SH0 mode when propagating in waveguides with constant or variable thickness. Finally, experiments are conducted on a variable thickness plate to verify the non-dispersive property of the SH0 mode and further compare the results with those of the Lamb modes. Recently developed thickness-poled omnidirectional shear horizontal piezoelectric transducers (OSH-PTs) are used to produce pure SH0 waves. It is observed that the velocity of the Lamb modes may change significantly and the group velocity of the S0 mode even decreases by 55.1\% during propagation, which hampers Lamb modes from defect identification in variable thickness plates. By contrast, the SH0 mode is non-dispersive thus promising for damage detection, and its effectiveness for defect localization in such structures is validated experimentally.},

To avoid possible risks, Lamb waves-based structural heath monitoring techniques have been applied to detect the internal damage of these composites. However, due to their intrinsic high degree of anisotropy which makes the failure mode complicated under fatigue loads, an accurate and timely method for damage detection of these composites is still challenging to realize. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting the internal delamination of the carbon fiber reinforced plastics by combining deep convolutional neural network and continuous wavelet transform. This data-driven method can effectively leverage the large amount of data without relying on complex feature extraction. After converting the time series signal into a two-dimensional time–frequency image by the continuous wavelet transform technique, the convolutional neural network model is applied to classify the images. Based on the prediction results of different paths by the model, a damage localization method is also proposed for ply delamination. An experimental study is implemented to verify the effectiveness of this method. The result shows this method is a useful technique for precise diagnosis and positioning of delamination damage in the composite structures.},

However, given the complexity of adhesive joint structures, EMIS capability for damage detection still needs to be thoroughly studied. In this manner, electrical impedance measurements were done to Single Lap Joints (SLJ), with both a modified epoxy adhesive and Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) for void detection. Void defects could not be detected on adhesive joints with the PSA but, in the case of joints with the modified epoxy adhesive, impedance signatures were significantly altered by the presence of both the artificially created void, and by a second damage source caused during the SLJ manufacture. Experimental measurements from modified epoxy joints were compared with simulation results, yielding good approximation when considering the effect of the second source of damage. An approximation of the mechanical impedance was also computed using numerical results from the pristine SLJ model.

	abstract = {“Industry 4.0” stands for the fourth industrial revolution, the transition from production by computer controlled isolated machines to the concept of a smart factory, where machines, materials, and personnel are digitally connected, to actively adapt to changes in workflow. It emerges from the confluence of operational technologies (OT) and information technologies (IT), which allows for higher flexibility and manufacturing of unique custom products to suit individual customer requirements. To assure quality, embracing digital transformation of non-destructive evaluation is essential. It can be an integral part of the cyber-controlled production and asset life-cycle maintenance. These two value propositions covering the asset life cycle, require digitally controlled NDE procedures and qualitative data to support automated decision making, for most known situations. With that scenario, NDE must be considered in conjunction with other engineering disciplines. Reliability assessments become a necessary prerequisite for the use of NDE data. In addition, the approach to inspector certification and experience needs to be revised. The digital technologies that are being deployed to enhance production under industry 4.0 can very well be the enablers of digitalized NDE and their integration with the asset and its owner. Model-based definition, smart robots, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and digital twins can all be used to enhance NDE inspections to a new level of performance in quality and safety assurance. These new NDE trends are summarized under the term “NDE 4.0” to meet the needs of Industry 4.0.

	abstract = {In recent years, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) based on Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) and damage detection tools has become a popular non-destructive solution to assess the real-time integrity of any kind of structure. This technique is especially well-suited for the condition-based conservation of historical structures, where minimal invasiveness must be ensured owing to their high cultural and architectural value. Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) techniques represent a valuable tool for efficiently designing the sensor layout in a SHM system in order to achieve an effective modal identification with a reduced number of sensors and, consequently, an improved cost efficiency. In this light, this paper proposes a design methodology of sensor networks based on OSP techniques suitable for historical structures. To do so, a preliminary extensive OMA campaign is conducted in order to construct a reliable finite element (FE) model by fitting the identified modal properties. Afterwards, an optimal sensor arrangement with a limited number of sensors is obtained by applying different model-based OSP techniques. In order to improve the robustness of the solution, material uncertainties are included in the model and the optimal sensor placement is conducted within a statistical framework. This methodology is presented and evaluated with a case study of a Spanish secular building: the Monastery of San Jerónimo de Buenavista in Seville (Spain). In particular, this paper presents the results of the preliminary ambient vibration test and the modal identification of the monastery, the updating process of the FE model, as well as a critical review of the different OSP techniques within a framework of material parameter uncertainty. The presented analysis demonstrate that OSP techniques based on the rank optimization of the kinetic energy matrix of the structure yield robust sensor layout.},

Damage index (DI) is a series of features extracted from Lamb wave signal that can be linked with damage, which can serve as an indicator to depict the damage. Conventional DIs including time-of-flight, amplitude change and signal difference coefficient are extracted from narrowband Lamb wave. However, time-of-flight needs prior knowledge of accurate propagation distance, amplitude change and signal difference coefficient rely on the collection of reference signals in undamaged condition. To overcome these limitations, different DIs are established from time-frequency distribution of broadband Lamb wave, which contains rich interaction information between structural feature and various modes over a large frequency range. In particular, three DIs including ridge curvature, energy distribution ratio and image difference coefficient, are extracted from Lamb wave time-frequency images and employed in probability imaging algorithm for damage localization. An experiment is given to validate the effectiveness of established time-frequency DIs.},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic phased array testing is a commonly used inspection modality in a range of non-destructive testing (NDT) fields. The recent rapid growth in demand for wind turbine installations means that blade manufacturers must address any potential NDT bottlenecks. Multi-aperture (MA) beamforming has previously been shown to increase frame rates, and hence inspection speed, when compared to traditional linear beamforming, in both NDT as well as medical applications. In this work an adaptive MA and spacing concept is presented to autonomously optimise the MA focal laws for the sample in question as well as a critical defect size. For this, full-matrix capture (FMC) data from a calibration sample, designed specifically for the target defect size and spacing, is used to drive the resultant optimised inspection scenario. A 6.7-fold increase in scanning speed with no degradation in resolution or defect sizing accuracy is reported. Three inspection scenarios are presented using firstly linear beamforming at 3.0 mms−1 and 22.0 mms−1 and finally MA beamforming at 22.0 mms−1. Resolutions of 0.8, 5.4 and 0.8 mm in the scan axis are recorded and consequently the optimum scenario, allowing for high resolution at the higher scanning speed, is presented. The concept and process are verified and validated by C-scan inspections of a carbon fibre re-enforced plastic (CFRP) sample, at varying inspection parameters, commonly used in high-power blade construction.},

In particular, the inspection of polycrystalline materials remains a challenge due to ultrasonic attenuation and backscatter noise caused by grain scattering. An adaptive ultrasonic array imaging algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is capable of enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of small subwavelength defects. The proposed approach adopts an iterative optimization procedure based on sequential backward selection, and is termed receiver optimized total focusing method (ROTFM). ROTFM is formulated in a baseline subtraction (BS) setting, and it is shown to achieve higher defect SNRs compared to TFM results obtained by directly applying the BS method to measured array data. More importantly, the performance of the proposed ROTFM is robust to time and spatial misalignments, and hence, it alleviates the need for complex compensation schemes when performing imaging computations. Compared to conventional TFM, ROTFM achieved an average SNR improvement of 3.41 dB and 6.05 dB in experiments for four test defects (cracks and holes of sizes 0.5 mm and 1 mm) at the frequencies of 5 MHz and 7 MHz, respectively.},

Considering the results of the experimental tests made it possible to model the resulting BVID with a realistic geometry and the location of delaminations, while the results of the numerical simulations allowed confirming and adjusting the damage extent. The original procedure of the BVID reconstruction from non-destructive testing data was developed and presented in the paper for the purpose of preparing the parametric computer-aided design (CAD) models. Using both numerical and experimental results the generic shapes of BVID for the set of various impact energies and various impactors were achieved.

Cure monitoring of composite materials using different fibre orientations, sensor locations, raw materials, and manufacturing methods has been widely studied. However, no consensus was reached due to differences in raw materials, temperature profile, manufacturing method, fibre orientation, and sensor location. The manufactured composite plate was then subjected to repeated loading during a quasi-static four-point bending test, and the strain development along the length of the DOF was recorded. Comparable results were obtained from the micro-braided and bare sections of the DOF, showing the suitability of micro-braided optical fibres for real-time strain monitoring in composite structures. The micro-braiding DOF facilitates handling for automated manufacturing methods and can be used to follow the full life cycle of a composite from fabrication till end-of-life.},

	abstract = {This work presents a nonlocal theory based on ordinary state-based (OSB) peridynamics for numerical modeling of crack propagation under loadings and peri‑ultrasound modeling for elastic wave propagation that interacts with generated cracks in 3-D plate structures. Propagating cracks in plate structures for two types of loading – tensile and shear are considered. For both loading cases, at six different times after the start of the loading the analysis is carried out to investigate how the results vary for these six different stages of crack propagation. An ultrasonic excitation is applied at a point on the surface of the plate to generate guided waves propagating through the plate structure and interacting with generated cracks at different stages of crack formation. The out-of-plane velocity fields are recorded at the receiving material point for further analysis. A relatively new and promising nonlinear ultrasonic (NLU) technique called sideband peak count-index (or SPC-I) is adopted to extract the nonlinear response due to the generated cracks. Results show that when the crack propagation is at its early stage the SPC-I value first increases, and then decreases with time at the advanced stages of crack propagation. This is because for both types of loading (tensile or shear) the newly generated cracks are small cracks (or micro-cracks) in the beginning and then they evolve into macro-cracks under increasing loadings. The observation for SPC-I trends is consistent with other numerical modelings and experimental observations reported in the literature, and such qualitative matching gives confidence in the proposed method. The proposed method combining the peri‑ultrasound modeling and SPC-I technique presented in this paper can provide a new insight for monitoring crack propagation and give some guidance for experimental structural health monitoring (SHM) applications.},

Instantaneous signals with different frequencies are applied to the structure and finite element analysis is performed to obtain vibration responses in both statuses. Features extracted by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are used to train and test the GP model to assess the health status of the structure.

	abstract = {Reinforcement corrosion is a major issue in reinforced concrete structures with severe societal and economic consequences if not detected and treated in time. This paper presents an elaborate experimental study to effectively monitor chloride-induced corrosion damage in reinforced concrete beams. A combined method of acoustic emission sensing and vibration-based monitoring is developed to detect, characterise and localise damage. Additionally, crack measurements on the concrete surface are performed as a reference technique. Four beams are corroded with an accelerated corrosion set-up while two additional beams are used as reference specimens. Whereas these monitoring techniques have already been applied individually to assess corrosion in reinforced concrete beams, they are here combined, in order to verify their complementarity. This results in an elaborate and innovative data-set which allows us to draw new conclusions on the way the techniques provide information on the evolution of corrosion damage in time and space. It was found that acoustic emission sensing can accurately detect and localise damage before cracking of the concrete, especially after dedicated noise filtering through clustering of the AE signals. Vibration-based monitoring is less sensitive to early damage, yet natural frequencies contain absolute information about the stiffness decrease due to corrosion damage, and strain mode shapes can localise damage on a larger scale. In addition, results from both techniques are in line with the crack measurements. As a result, the combination of these various monitoring methods offers valuable and complementary insights about the corrosion process.},

In water-immersed plate structures, most of the guided wave modes have strong attenuation due to energy leakage into the surrounding liquid. However, there is an interface wave mode known as quasi-Scholte waves, which can propagate with low attenuation. Therefore, this mode is promising for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. This paper presents an analysis of the capability of quasi-Scholte waves in detecting internal corrosion-like defects in water-immersed structures. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model is developed to simulate quasi-Scholte wave propagation and wave scattering phenomena on a steel plate with one side exposed to water. The accuracy of the model is validated through experimental measurements. There is good agreement between the FE simulations and experimental measurements. The experimentally verified 3D FE model is then employed in a series of parametric studies to analyze the scattering characteristics of quasi-Scholte waves at circular blind holes with different diameters and depths, which are the simplest representation of progressive corrosion. The findings of this study can enhance the understanding of quasi-Scholte waves scattering at corrosion damage of structures submerged in water and help improve the performance of in-situ damage detection techniques.},

	abstract = {In the modern world, civil engineering structures are of paramount importance. Early damage detection through continuous health monitoring, instead of conventional periodic inspection, is the promising way forward for healthy structures with the least maintenance requirement. The damage is identified at the initial stage, so the cost associated with its repair can be reduced. Considering the immense scale of civil infrastructure, currently, available structural health monitoring systems are not feasible for mass application as they are prohibitively expensive. Hence, it is the need of the hour to develop a remote real-time Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS). In the current study, a system is proposed that utilizes a vibration-based structural health monitoring approach and extracts dynamic parameters from acceleration data. The system consists of a node tasked with data collection and transmission and a server assigned with data post-processing and results display. The node comprises the following main hardware components: ESP32 as a microcontroller unit and ADXL345 as an accelerometer. The system was developed with the capability of multiple node integration, onboard data storage to eliminate sampling rate inconsistencies, dual trigger modes to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), power usage optimization to prolong stand-by time, and wireless data transmission along with automated post-processing. To minimize the cost of the system, Internet of Things (IoT) technology was adopted to develop the system.},

Accordingly, a comprehensive study of the effects of matrix cracks – e.g. their size and crack density – and the influence of different damage types and their interaction on the vibro-acoustic modulation (VAM) behaviour of CFRP specimens under fatigue loading was carried out. These effects were evaluated in two sets of commonly employed laminate layups. Firstly, in a cross-ply (CP) layup, the number of 90°layers was varied, with a constant areal weight (268g/m2). Secondly, quasi-isotropic (QI) specimens were tested, where the areal weight was reduced from thick-ply to thin-ply (30–268 g/m2), changing the failure mode from a delamination-dominated to a brittle failure. After damage introduction under tension–tension loading (R=0.1), high-frequency Lamb waves are introduced via piezoceramic actuators and modulated by a low-frequency vibration using a servo-hydraulic testing machine. VAM correlates with the different damage behaviour and damage conditions in CFRP. For this purpose, the evolution of the sideband amplitudes, the modulation index, the signal in time domain and X-ray scans are used. Regardless of the layup, the degree of stiffness-reducing inter-fibre fractures and large-scale delaminations can be detected.},

The problem of the similarity of signals corresponding to different types of anomalies was considered. Thanks to the application of principal component analysis and a procedure employing a combination of artificial neural networks, the extraction of the most significant features of the registered signals was possible. The proposed procedure proved to be very sensitive and accurate for the proper detection of anomalies, as well as for the determination of their location and type, even if the loosening of bolts was very slight (i.e., invisible to the naked eye). The most important element of the presented approach is the fact that the combination of the assessment of the condition of local parts along with the application of artificial intelligence techniques can result in a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system that allows for the global assessment of structural integrity.},

	abstract = {The article explores the material and structural size effects on the electrical impedance response of the embedded PZT sensors which are used as an sensors/actuator in the smart sensing concrete. An embedded sensor for use in concrete monitoring is developed using Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT). The electrical impedance (EI) response of the sensor placed inside concrete cubes of varying sizes are recorded for an applied electrical input of varying frequency. The dynamic response of the embedded PZT sensor to the applied electrical input is determined by the mechanical impedance offered by the surrounding medium. In specimens of finite size, the mechanical impedance to the motion of the PZT is influenced by the combination of dynamic material resistance and structural stiffness (size of the structure). The current study examined the effects of material resistance and size of structure on the EI response of the PZT sensor embedded in concrete medium. The influence of the size of the medium from small-sized specimens is seen in the form of secondary peaks, identified as structural peaks, on the resonance spectrum of the embedded PZT sensor. The structural peaks on the EI response are very dominant in the concrete cube of small sizes. Magnitude and intensity of these structural peaks attenuate with an increase in the size of the concrete cube. Also, the EI response from the smaller-sized specimens registered a significant leftward shift in the spectrum. The observations from the numerical simulations also showed the mechanical impedance of the surrounding concrete medium to the motion of the PZT also increases and converges at 150 mm. At sizes below 150 mm, the structural effects that are influenced by the specimen boundary must be separated to access the material properties of the concrete medium from the measured EI response of an embedded PZT sensor. At sizes, larger than 150 mm, the dynamic motion of the PZT patch and the measured EI response of the PZT patch depend only on the dynamic material properties of the concrete medium around the sensor. The zone of influence and its importance in standardization of PZT sensor for SHM of concrete structures is discussed.},

The framework consists of two stages for dimensionality reduction through (1) a principal component analysis and (2) an autoencoder. The first stage reduces the dimensionality of the input data. This allows the architecture of the autoencoder to be relatively shallow, which means that the deep learning model is fast to train and does not need as much training data. The output of the autoencoder contains artefact information (originating from structural features) and is projected back to the original domain. This is subtracted from the input data in order to isolate defect and noise information. The framework trains on defect-free experimental data and it does not require a large amount of training data. An optimisation approach to arrive at a near-optimal framework architecture is also proposed. An ultrasonic phased-array imaging application is used to illustrate the methodology and compared against the state-of-the-art deep learning approach to suppressing artefacts. The proposed method proves to be effective at suppressing artefacts leading to a good defect detection and characterisation performance.},

	abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a multidisciplinary damage detection technique that incorporates various mechanisms, of which guided waves (GWs) -based damage detection is one of the critical fields of research. To realize the complete process of SHM, research on GWs has concentrated on diagnosis and localization. GWs-based damage detection technology is widely used in plate structure, combining different sensor placement algorithms and equipment such as scanning laser doppler vibrometry (SLDV) to achieve accurate damage location. Simultaneously, developing the finite element method (FEM) allows for precise simulation in discontinuous media and complex sharp structures. Therefore, this paper combines the theoretical calculation approach of elastic wave propagation with the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, using the excitation signal and signal reflected by damage as the input matrix and target matrix, respectively. Thus, the reflection-waves coefficient matrix (RCM) containing damage information could be obtained after calculation by the OMP algorithm. Besides, a prediction approach of reference reflected signal based on four-layers recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is proposed with experiments data to reduce the difficulty of expanding a dictionary matrix in a plate with multiple defects, which allows for predicting the damage reflection signal under different distances with 88.14\% accuracy. And finally, considering the aluminum plate with hole damage as an example, the experiment results show that the proposed approaches are effective for the localization of single damage and muti-damage. Meanwhile, the prospects and limitations of the algorithm for precise localization are also addressed in the last.},

	abstract = {For engineering applications of guided-wave-based online structural damage detection, dealing with uncertainty caused by time-varying conditions (TVCs) is an issue of fundamental importance. In this study, a structural adaptive damage detection method based on probability dissimilarity and moving average control chart (MACC) is proposed. To suppress the uncertain effects of TVCs on signals, the probability dissimilarity-based damage index (PDDI) is extracted based on the proposed adaptive probability modeling of signal feature and probability distribution dissimilarity measure. Then, the automatic damage alarm mechanism based on MACC is proposed to determine alarm threshold adaptively and restrain the uncertain influence further by the moving average of PDDI. The proposed method is verified by the damage detection experiments on typical aircraft lug specimens under varying load and temperature, and then the method is applied to the full-scale aircraft fatigue test. The results demonstrate that the proposed method realizes reliable and adaptive structural damage detection under uncertain conditions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the hybrid Delay-And-Sum (DAS) with Sparse Reconstruction (SR) method was further developed for damage location in composite plates. In composite materials, anisotropy leads to some challenges in using conventional damage location methods, which are developed for isotropic materials. In the hybrid DAS-SR method, the DAS and SR methods were combined as a complement of each other. To investigate the DAS-SR method for composite structures, the group velocity of the travelling wave for different directions was first measured experimentally via PZTs. The DAS and SR formulations were then modified to be compatible with the direction-dependent group velocities. The results show that this modification increases the accuracy of the DAS and SR methods for damage location in a composite plate. However, using group-velocity instead of phase-velocity in the standard SR method, causes some model mismatch and errors in the damage localization and this problem was solved by using the modified hybrid DAS-SR method. The experimental results demonstrated that the performance of the modified hybrid method for detection and location of barely visible impact damages as well as for multi-location artificial damages is better than that of the DAS and SR methods when separately used.},

The main objective of work consists of developing a new method to assessment of damage in carbon composite by using a different method to be applied to structural health monitoring. Experiments were carried out on laboratory specimens, which consists of carbon/epoxy laminates having three different stacking sequences ([0/0]s, [0/90]s, and [45/0–45/90]s) subjected to three different impact energies (7 J, 14 J, and 24 J) using conical shape impactor. Frequency Response Function (FRF) for intact and damaged specimens was obtained by using hammer and accelerometer sensors. FRFs are analysed using suitable metrics, including a new one, which is compared in terms of their capability for damage identification. Afterword, the ultrasonic C-scanning method is used to locate and quantify the damage in the specimen. The ultrasonic C-scanning works on the principle of ultrasonic reflection at the interface of impedance mismatch. In this method defects are based on the amplitude of ultrasonic high-speed waves; a qualitative approach is used to identifying the defects while measuring the amplitude of the signals. This technique has demonstrated great potential for damage localization and extension in carbon composites. Finally, the new method is proposed to identify and localization of damage in the impacted specimen using the Vibration-based method and Ultrasonic C-scanning methods.},

The innovation of this paper is the development of an automatic monitoring method for bolt tightness using acoustic emission (AE) and deep learning (DL). Initially, AE sensors are first used to monitor structural bolts, and AE signals are preprocessed by a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to obtain different time–frequency components, which are then fed into the convolutional neural network (CNN). To reduce the amount of training parameters and enhance the capacity for feature extraction, transfer learning (TL) is introduced to train the model. In the experimental scenario, the bolts exhibit seven categories of tightness. The findings show that the proposed method can accurately classify the bolts’ tightness, and can be used to monitor the early looseness of the bolts online.},

Mechanical performance is not negatively affected by the addition of CNTs, due to their good distribution inside the adhesive. Moreover, the electrical resistance increases with displacement in both Single Lap Shear (SLS) and Mode-I joints, due to the combined effect of adhesive deformation and crack propagation. More specifically, Mode-I joints usually show a stick–slip behaviour with sharp increases and arrest phases in the electrical resistance, associated to changes in the failure modes. Furthermore, a structural health monitoring (SHM) test of a composite repair was carried out by different techniques such as acoustic emission, strain gauges and CNT adhesive monitoring. From electrical monitoring of the CNT adhesive, it is possible to identify some load thresholds from which the electrical resistance starts to increase. They coincide with sudden changes of the strain field monitored by the strain gauges, as well as, with sudden peaks of the sound level, being an indicative of crack nucleation, adhesive deformation and, finally, crack propagation. Therefore it highlights the great potential and robustness for on-line SHM purpose of the proposed CNT-doped adhesive films.},

According to the fundamental principles of water irrigation and electric heating method, we introduced a novel approach that leveraged the cooling law of the point heat source in the monitoring tube to estimate the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, to further detect cracks based on the variations in axial flow velocity. Numerical simulations were initially conducted to investigate the effects of factors such as the size effect, flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, combination scheme of the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, and heating power on the cooling law of the heat source, to further determined an optimized monitoring scheme. A series of model tests was then conducted based on this optimized scheme. First, the relationship between cooling discrimination index and axial flow velocity was calibrated. Then, by adjusting the water pressure, the leakage rates under different crack widths could be obtained, allowing for the derivation of a fitting formula to estimate the crack width using the water pressure and leakage rate. Finally, in double crack specimen, the proposed multi-crack identification method, along with the calibration relationship and fitting formula, was used to perform the crack inversion. The inverted crack widths showed good agreement with the actual crack widths, with an RMSE value of 0.0212 mm.},

	abstract = {This study introduces an advanced, non-contact diagnostic tool for structural health monitoring of fatigue damage in fiber/polymer composite materials. The approach combines thermal image recognition of fatigue self-heating hotspots with high-fidelity thermal modeling to quantitatively assess subsurface fatigue damage distributions by machine learning. To this end, artificial thermal images are generated through 3D numerical thermal analysis of an inherent fatigue damage heat source within a glass/epoxy composite, derived from sampling a multivariate Gaussian distribution of microcracks. Subsequently, these synthetic thermal images are employed to train three distinct regression models: a convolutional neural network, a Gaussian processes regressor, and a straightforward least squares model. Various image augmentation techniques are applied to expand the dataset efficiently. All models accurately predict the size of the damage and – most importantly – the maximum temperature within the damage deep inside the composite. The regression methods estimate the diagonal elements of covariance matrix components of the Gaussian distribution, with accuracies ranging from 86\% to 99\%. The findings presented in this work contribute to establishing a solid foundation for non-destructive subsurface fatigue damage assessment in composite materials, with many practical applications in experimental composites fatigue research.},

The uncertainty of the crack location, however, will cause a sensitivity variation, which is tightly related to the operating mode and field distribution. A cylindrical ring dielectric resonator (CRDR) is proposed to cope with this issue in this paper. According to the shape perturbation of the EM resonator, the presence of the crack can cause an increase in the stored magnetic energy over the stored electric energy inside the crack, resulting in a resonant frequency shift to the lower frequency region. By comparing with cylindrical dielectric resonator (CDR), the sensing principle and crack detection capability based on the proposed CRDR is demonstrated in both simulation and experiment. The information gathered from this type of sensor can be used to support predictive maintenance, repair, and decision making for structural health monitoring (SHM) in extreme environments.},

	abstract = {The early work on long range guided wave nondestructive testing (NDT) was largely done in industry, and multiple applications were developed before a surge in academic interest starting in the early 1990s. This paper reviews the history of the field, covering the topics that must be addressed in the design of a test procedure, as well as applications in both NDT and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). The use of guided waves in long range NDT is relatively mature, and largely limited to simple structures in applications that are difficult or impossible to address by conventional point inspection methods. Point methods are impractical in most large area SHM applications where it is necessary to detect isolated defects since it is not possible to cover the whole area of interest with transducers. Guided waves therefore have great potential in SHM as they enable a large area of structure to be monitored from a limited number of transduction locations, so reducing the added weight, cost and complexity of the attachment to the structure. It is also possible to improve the sensitivity of the test relative to that obtained in one-off inspection by monitoring the change in signals with time using baseline subtraction. Current SHM deployments are largely in the same types of structure as those where guided wave NDT is used, but there is substantial potential for increasing the range of applications. The paper concludes with a review of the research and development needs for this potential to be realised.},

	abstract = {An inductively coupled ultrasonic transducer system (ICTS) is a lightweight, wireless, battery-free, and low-profile (0.5 mm thick) permanently installed sensor system for measuring remaining wall thickness at fixed locations for structural health monitoring. In an ICTS, a slight variation in measured thickness has been observed that is dependent on the misalignment between the handheld probing unit and the permanently attached sensor. A correction algorithm has been developed to improve the ultimate thickness measurement performance of ICTS even with misalignment. The algorithm eliminates a system delay from the measured first arrival time based on the measured bandwidth of the cross-talk signal. Crucially, the algorithm does not require identification of the second back-wall echo as this is not always possible if the back surface of the structure is badly corroded. The correction algorithm has successfully improved the thickness measurement precision from 0.19 mm to 0.07 mm. A higher accuracy of thickness measurement is also achieved, with the mean of the corrected thicknesses equals to the true thickness to ±0.01 mm. The algorithm also enabled the detection of a thickness loss of 0.09 mm. The improvement on thickness measurement performance is important for manual inspection, and future robotic interrogation which will become more viable as up to 20 mm lateral misalignment and 10 mm vertical misalignment can be accommodated.},

Monitoring of the early age corrosion of the reinforcements can contribute to an effective planning of structural maintenance and restoration. This paper demonstrates an innovative approach of monitoring the rate of corrosion (mass loss due to corrosion) of steel bars embedded in concrete by capturing conductance signature using Piezoelectric sensors (PZT) by Electromechanical Impedance Technique. In the recent times Wavelet Transform (WT) based different techniques have been proved to be promising techniques for different structural health monitoring assessment. This study aims to comprehensively use the WT techniques based on EMI signals to assess the corrosion levels in the reinforcement embedded in RC members. Specifically, the study focuses on capturing the progression of corrosion levels using the RMSD index derived from the DWT, CWT and WPT analysis of conductance signatures. WT techniques provides energy values of conductance signatures. Energy level of the signatures decreases with the increase of corrosion levels and deviation of energy level between current and pristine stage is measured using statistical index Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). Robust relationship between the RMSD index and the corrosion mass loss ratio through nonlinear curve fitting have been derived and presented using data captured from the 48 specimens of concrete cylinders with embedded reinforcement. At last, the comparison between the actual mass loss ratio and the predicted mass loss ratio derived from these techniques have been made for the validation of the proposed relation of predicted mass loss due to corrosion.},

Multisensing, reusable, and non-bonded configurations of PZT patches for impedance-based health monitoring are gaining popularity because of their simplicity and robustness. However, the steel bar's complex or uneven surface restricts the PZT patch's direct bonding to the host structure. This article evaluates the effectiveness of different multisensing configuration of PZT patch to monitor the loading effect and structural damage in constructional steel rebar, i.e., surface bonded, clamped and metal wire (MW) attached. Statistical and piezo frequency-based damage indices were used to assess the PZT's effective configuration. The experimental findings of this study have shown the efficacy of multi modal piezo configuration for monitoring damage and loading effects, particularly. Furthermore, the study has expanded to find piezo-equivalent structural parameters for multitudinal piezo position to identify its suitability and effectiveness for better structural health assessment and monitoring. The comparison of indices was highlighted to find a more productive PZT configuration for sensing structural change and damage highlighting the effectiveness of the non-bonded PZT patch configuration.

Results show that keeping and breaking the symmetry of the electric boundary condition can, respectively, lead to decoupling or hybridizing of multi-mode Lamb waves. Accordingly, the asymmetric transmission at a desired frequency can be realized by combining the symmetric and asymmetric electric boundary conditions. Harmonic analysis shows that numerical results are in good agreement with the prediction of complex band structure.

Four point load tests were carried out on a 68 m long, Douglas fir timber truss instrumented with conventional electric strain gauges, distributed fibre optic sensors, and string potentiometers, among other instruments. These instruments makeup a larger, long-term structural health monitoring program implemented within the truss structure. The objectives of the local point load tests were to (1) confirm the in-situ monitoring instruments are in working order, (2) compare calculated mechanical properties with assumed properties, and (3) calibrate a numerical model capable of replicating truss response and compare to current modeling standards used within the Department of National Defence. Non-destructive testing, including moisture content and cable tension tests, was also conducted to determine existing material properties. Load testing and non-destructive testing results identified variations between the existing properties of the truss and the assumed properties of certain structural members, as well as identifying possible lower strength or stiffness values of stress-reversed members. Results also indicated the importance of analyzing timber as an orthotropic, bimodular material for reliability and conservatism, particularly in numerical modeling. Lastly, the results presented in this paper outline the importance of in-situ load testing with an aim to determine existing material properties for monitoring projects. Moreover, the identification of the existing properties and behaviour of the structure is fundamental in the development of a structural health monitoring program for emergency purposes.},

	abstract = {Metals are essentially used to construct structures of high economic importance, but their service life is shortened by damage such as crack, corrosion, cavity, and dents. Damage to structure causes gradual degradation of its strength and compromises its load-carrying capacity. Some damage could be designed against but pitting corrosion, especially when it is filled with debris that would hide it and deepen its perforation activities. In this work, monitoring the evolution of debris-filled damage in structure is studied using pre-modulated wave and guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT). The structural responses in the varying percentage of debris-filled damage were processed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Hilbert Transform (HT) and correlation techniques. The regression analysis of debris-filled damage resulted in empirical predictive models that could detect the damage and percentage of debris that might have filled it with average percentage errors of 1.34 and 0.21, respectively. The debris in the damage caused an overmodulation of the high-frequency signal. The intensity of the lower sideband (LSB) was observed to be very sensitive to variations in the damage than the upper sideband (USB). The transmission power efficiency of modulation sidebands increased proportionally with debris-filled damage percentage and could serve as a damage index.},

Various monitoring strategies are considered, including different inspection parameters, techniques and inspection intervals. Parameters include fundamental mode period, crack width, and residual displacement. Incremental damage is estimated by comparing the post-event measurement of a particular parameter of the structure with the most recent information available. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate sequences of hazards, including earthquakes, corrosion and scour, and their joint (interacting) effects on bridges. Applications of the framework are described for a typical multiple-column pier and simply-supported deck concrete bridge, as is common in the Central and Southeastern United States. The objective function considered for risk-informed post-earthquake monitoring of bridges can vary depending on the actual condition of the bridge and its safety requirements. Our methodology prioritizes maximizing damage prediction accuracy, which suggests different optimal monitoring planning throughout the life of the bridge.},

	abstract = {Distributed point source method (DPSM) is a collocation point-based semi-analytical method to model the scattered ultrasonic fields in isotropic and anisotropic materials. It requires the evaluation of Green's function solutions and its rigorous differentiation for complex geometry problems having a large set of distributed point sources. DPSM is much faster than the finite element method (FEM) however, it is analytically demanding as it requires differentiation of the Green's function. The intricacy associated with differentiation operation hinders the potential application of DPSM in large-scale automation and real-time structural health monitoring. The current paper introduces machine-learning-based strategies within DPSM and yields the proposed Neural Green-DPSM (NG-DPSM) framework. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is incorporated in the DPSM framework for evaluating the Green's function and its gradients. To train the PINN, displacement Green's function solutions of wave propagation in isotropic solid is used as the governing physics. Once the PINN is trained for displacement Green's function solutions, the NG-DPSM framework leverages the trained network and its automatic differentiation capability to predict displacement and stress fields annihilating the rigorous differentiation of Green's functions. The accuracy and efficacy of NG-DPSM are demonstrated using two numerical experiments. First, the ultrasonic fields are evaluated for the problem geometry of a plate immersed in fluid excited at different angles of incidence. Further, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated for wave scattering through a circular hole in the plate. The results show a strong agreement between the ultrasonic fields computed using both NG-DPSM and conventional DPSM.},

In this paper, a method for analyzing the guided wave propagation characteristics of the turnout straight switch rail with variable cross-section is proposed, and the effectiveness of the method verified by finite element simulation and field experiments. The results show that the dispersion characteristics of the turnout straight switch rail change slowly along the longitudinal direction, and that at a local level the dispersion characteristics are in fact similar to rails of constant cross-section. Based on this, a three-dimensional dispersion surface with cross-sectional position information is proposed, after which the variation regularity of dispersion characteristics along the longitudinal direction is analyzed in combination with the mode shapes of the cross section at different positions. This method can provide a theoretical basis for damage detection in turnout straight switch rail, as well as for the selection of guided wave frequency and mode recognition.},

	abstract = {Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR), commonly known as ‘concrete cancer,’ is an expansive reaction occurring over time between aggregate constituents and alkaline hydroxides from cement. As a destructive phenomenon, the need to detect the onset of ASR in concrete structures to ensure their long-term durability and structural integrity is thus evidenced. In the structural health monitoring field, vision-based approaches have been found to be viable, fast, and cost-effective in diagnosing numerous types of cracks using physical attributes and surface patterns. However, achieving high accuracy in detecting ASR cracks using traditional visual inspection techniques is challenging and time-consuming. Inspired by artificial intelligence technology, this paper proposes and evaluates a two-phase computer vision procedure for detecting and classifying ASR cracks utilizing a collection of ASR images recorded from several bridges in Queensland, Australia. In the first phase, the procedure compares common pre-trained CNN models to investigate their capability in classifying ASR cracks and to select the best-performed model. In the second phase, a novel Feature Enhancement Process (FEP) was first proposed to increase the contrast between ASR cracks and the heavily textured backgrounds within the images. Next, to better highlight the ASR crack features, the feature-adjusted images are processed further through different texture analysis algorithms including: (i) Texture Morphology, (ii) Adaptive thresholding, and (iii) Local range filtering. The study shows that the proposed FEP can improve the ASR crack classification accuracy of InceptionV3, which is the best CNN model selected from Phase 1, from 90.9\% to 92.48\%. Furthermore, by combining FEP with texture morphology, a robust two-stage tool for assessing ASR cracks can be made with an impressive validation accuracy of 94.07\%. This research contributes towards the application of novel AI deep learning technology in providing cost-effective autonomous ASR crack classification tools to support the owners and managers of civil public works assets and other constructed infrastructures.},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors presented a smart sensing method for monitoring and evaluating the early-age hydration and hardening process of cement mortar through the integration of the EMI technique with deep learning (DL) models. The main research works and contributions of this research are given as follows: The development of the penetration resistance was acquired by measuring the Vicat needle penetration depth. Meanwhile, the EMI spectra within two scanning frequency ranges, 1000 kHz and 3000 kHz, were continuously captured. The key innovation of this research is that a DL-based framework named EMI-integrated neural network (EMI-IntNet) was proposed, which could facilitate the achievement of intelligent monitoring and assessment. The EMI-IntNet, which combines a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) and an attention mechanism, can accurately predict the dynamic penetration impedance from raw EMI data without any pre-processing or subjective judgment. Two datasets collected in two separate vibration modes (d31 and d33) were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the EMI-IntNet can quantitatively evaluate the dynamic penetration impedance of cement mortar with an error of less than 2 \% and a coefficient of determination (R2) value over 0.99 for both datasets. The EMI-IntNet’s forecasting accuracy, noise immunity and adaptability were thoroughly investigated, which outperform that of the machine learning-based approaches, 1D-CNN and 1D-CNN-LSTM. In conclusion, the proposed method enables automatic data acquisition, feature extraction and identification of EMI signals, contributing to the intelligent monitoring and accurate assessment of the mechanical impedance change throughout the early-age hydration and setting of cement mortar.},

	abstract = {The typical failure in fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminated composites is delamination. It reduces structural stiffness and changes in dynamic responses, which can be successfully used for assessing structural health monitoring (SHM) of composite structures. SHM often requires the solution of an inverse problem. This study focuses on solving the inverse problem with minimal computational time to predict delamination size, in-plane location, and interface. For the inverse model, two computational intelligence algorithms, the surrogate-assisted real-coded genetic algorithm (SARGA) and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used. A surrogate model is a fast-executing model for predicting the shift in the natural frequency using a forward ANN. For ANN training, the database size was optimized. The layerwise theory was solved using the finite element method for a laminated tapered FRP plate with ply drop-off, and ‘constrained mode’ is used to model the delamination. The experimental modal analysis was conducted on a glass-fibre reinforced polymer tapered composite plate with one intact plate and three artificially delaminated plates. The algorithms are validated using numerically simulated and experimentally measured frequencies. The numerical validation showed a better prediction of delamination size, in-plane location, and interface when compared with the experimental validation. Nevertheless, SARGA can reasonably predict the size, in-plane (x) location and interface of the delamination with an average overlapping ratio of 72.89\%. The comparison of algorithms demonstrates the application of SARGA with the frequency-based approach for delamination detection and real-time condition monitoring in real-world applications.},

However, most NDT arrays are 1-dimensional (1D), which generate 2-dimensional (2D) images from a single position and lack the ability to focus accurately through surfaces that are curved in multiple directions. In this paper, a 2D phased array is used to experimentally image artificial defects (represented by bottom-drilled holes and electrical discharge machined notches) within a test specimen with a doubly-curved surface profile in an immersion configuration. The array is mechanically scanned above the entire surface of the specimen and the 3-dimensional (3D), or volumetric, images generated at each position are combined to produce a single image of the specimen's entire surface. The surface profile is then extracted and discretised for interior volumetric imaging. The results show that the root mean square (RMS) error between the ultrasonically extracted surface and the true surface is 0.04 mm and 95\% of absolute errors are less than 0.07 mm. Finally, the positions of visible defects are measured, using (i) the depth above the back wall and (ii) the lateral distance from a notch on the specimen's surface, and compared to their true values. The study shows that the standard deviation of depth and lateral position measurements is 0.68 mm and 0.89 mm respectively. Defects that are located beneath regions of sufficiently steep surface curvature were unable to be imaged.},

	abstract = {Laminate composites are widely used in industrial applications due to their high material strength and efficiency. In such materials, impact loads can cause internal delaminations at the bonding interfaces between sublayers, which further growth during operation could lead to structural failure. Guided wave based non-destructive testing allows detecting such hidden delamination, which manifests itself in the wavefield disturbance at the obstacle vicinity. However, their sizing requires sophisticated post-processing of the acquired wave signals. In our previous studies, a method for sizing an internal strip-like crack in a homogeneous elastic plate has been developed and experimentally approved. The method is based on the numerical evaluation of the scattering resonance frequencies depending on the crack size, and their comparison with the experimentally obtained ones. In the present paper, we extend this approach to the case of dissimilar-material laminates. Numerical simulation and laser Doppler vibrometry measurements were carried out for bi-layer samples composed of various combinations of glued steel, aluminium, and glass sublayers with artificial strip-like delamination. The results obtained confirm the possibility of damage width estimation using the values of scattering resonance frequencies extracted from the signals acquired at the sample surface.},

	abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems have a potential to reduce lifecycle costs of structures through maintenance planning and lifetime extension. Hence, there is a lot of active research in the area for SHM of civil and mechanical structures. The SHM system should be low cost, suitable for continuous monitoring, able to detect small levels of damage. Guided waves (GW) based SHM techniques allow monitoring of large thin-walled structures with a few sensors and have been identified as the most promising of techniques for SHM. The GW based techniques allow mapping of damage very easily, and hence are a powerful tool for assessing the damage. The mapping of damage with high resolution is of course computationally expensive and hinders real-time decision making. Hence, methods are being developed to minimize the processing time. In this paper, the authors implement a sequential niching particle swarm optimization (PSO) for multiple damage detection. It is shown that the niching PSO is able to detect multiple damage scenarios effectively. The processing time is significantly better (order of magnitude) hence making it suitable for real-time assessment. The paper also presents some sensitivity studies, for determination of the thresholds. The validation has been conducted experimentally on an aluminum plate instrumented with piezo-actuators for actuation and FBG sensor for sensing. The results indicate that the niching PSO is suitable and indeed a better alternative than the brute-force techniques commonly used in literature.},

Second harmonic Lamb waves, which result from the interaction of fundamental waves with material microstructural defects, have great potential for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications. However, understanding of the second harmonic generation in composite laminates remains largely insufficient, which hinders practical SHM applications. This issue is investigated in this study to highlight the quasi-cumulative second harmonic B2 mode Lamb wave in the low frequency range. Theoretical analyses are conducted to ascertain how anisotropy affects the quasi-cumulative effect, followed and validated by numerical simulations and analyses considering different wave propagation angles. The characteristics of the second harmonic B2 mode Lamb waves are further explored in terms of the cumulative feature, robustness to wave beam divergence, and excitability. Experiments are finally carried out to monitor material degradation during the thermal aging of a carbon fiber reinforced panel. The results confirm the omnidirectional cumulative effect of quasi-phase-matched second harmonic B2 mode Lamb waves. It is revealed that the 0° propagating Lamb waves exhibit superior cumulative effect, high robustness to wave beam divergence, and good excitability, rendering them an ideal tool for SHM applications. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of the second harmonic B2 mode waves to material degradation is demonstrated, confirming their promise for material degradation monitoring applications in composite structures.},

First of all, the stress wave signals were continuously captured during the concrete curing process using PZT-enabled active sensing, and then the time-frequency diagrams were generated from the collected signals through the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). After that, an innovative DL-based framework named concrete early-age strength monitoring network (CESMonitorNet) was developed to automatically learn optimal features from the CWT spectrum and ultimately quantify the early-age concrete strength. Finally, experiments on laboratory-cast concrete specimens were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comprehensive comparison analysis with the widely used machine learning-based methods and convolutional neural network (CNN) was also performed.

	abstract = {Sandwich panels with carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) have high flexural strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios and are used in structures requiring good mechanical properties, such as aircrafts and marine vehicles. In this study, the overall displacement of a sandwich panel with CFRP faces and an aluminum honeycomb core was reconstructed using the inverse finite element method (iFEM). The full in-plane strain fields were input into the iFEM and reproduced from the measured strains and an interpolation technique. We propose an interpolation method to calculate the overall strain fields on the sandwich panel based on strain distributions measured by fiber-optic sensors and numerically showed that the fully distributed sensing yields accurate and robust results in both strain and displacement reconstructions. To validate the proposed method, fiber-optic sensors were embedded in the sandwich panel, and strain distributions were measured by the sensing system with optical frequency domain reflectometry. In these experiments, we successfully and accurately measured the strain distributions along the embedded fibers and reconstructed the overall strain fields and displacement of the sandwich panel under four load cases. Furthermore, the sandwich panel shape identified by the proposed method can be employed for structural health monitoring.},

A global area analysis using laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) with piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuator-based guided waves (GW) excitation was used to detect and locate the damage. The GW full wavefield (FWF) mode conversion and root mean square (RMS) based LDV studies helped to visualize the impact crack damage (ICD) when tested at varying excitation frequencies. The experimental results were cross-verified numerically using the spectral element method (SEM). The implemented structural health monitoring (SHM) based sectorial elliptical code (SEC) reduced the overall calculation time in damage localization and accurately identified the damage from experimental and numerical data. An infrared thermography (IRT)-based crack identification algorithm was developed in pinpointing the ICD shape. The automatic method removes the influence of high heat sources and highlights the damage zones easily. The accuracy of the localization strategy was successfully verified with non-contact active IRT analysis. The crack size and damage severity were quantified using the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) method with a solution mixture based organic dye. The global area method allows detecting possible damage, validated and quantified with the non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques.},

An extensive network consisting of 72 piezoelectric transducers installed on the panel via diagnostic film, a layer including sensors and inkjet printed flexible circuits, that provides uniform bonding quality and repairability. Threshold setting for damage detection is proposed based on statistical distribution of pristine signals, obtained throughout the span of one month. The threshold is determined through an Outlier Analysis and validated through an iterative cross-validation approach. The model validation yields a Gamma distribution with 1.5\% false positive rate. A total of 20 impacts at different energies are conducted on the panel for BVID generation and these are respectively categorized based on their location. Methodologies were developed in order to detect, characterize, and localize the BVID generated from the impacts at various locations of the panel. The reliability of the SHM system is quantified by the Probability of Detection for each damage category by computing the damage area with 90\% probability and 95\% confidence level (a90{\textbar}95 values). For damages in the skin and at the foot of the stringer a90{\textbar}95 values of 233 mm2 and 365 mm2 are, respectively, obtained.

However, debonding problems which can occur at the interface severely impair the performance of retrofitted structures. In this paper, a guided wave based structural health monitoring (SHM) method is employed to detect debonding in CFRP-reinforced steel structures. The proposed samples are CFRP-reinforced steel plates with different sizes of debonding. Due to its sensitivity to interfacial damage, the anti-symmetrical Lamb wave mode is chosen as the incident wave and surface-mounted piezoelectric (PZT) wafers are employed to excite and collect the signals. Theoretical derivation is introduced to find the relationship between the time-of-flight (ToF) of the first arrival wave package in the received signals and the extent of debonding damage. A linear relationship is obtained, in that the ToF decreases linearly with the increase in the size of debonding. When corresponding numerical simulation and experimental study are performed to verify the relationship, similar trends are observed.},

Wave mode, as well as other wavenumber based filtering techniques have been presented to address many of these limitations. This work describes a novel application of Wave Mode Spectroscopy (WMS) along with feature detection for complex geometric shapes. The specimen's geometry is found during the wavefields measurement through the use of a 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) allowing the wavefield to be mapped to a 2D plane with limited distortion of the wavelength and without any prior knowledge of the part's geometry. This was shown to allow WMS to be applied to continuous, multi-frequency wavefields and generate accurate thickness maps. Monogenic signal analysis has been applied to the same measurement data to generate amplitude maps that allow the automatic detection of edge features through the use of a Canny edge detection algorithm.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a model-free damage identification method and suggests an effective index for damage diagnosis in steel plate-like structures considering both the torsion and bending moments using only acceleration data, with no need for geometric characteristics. The basis for damage detection is the difference between healthy and damaged structural responses to different ground accelerations. In doing so, two Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) scales, 0.05 (g), and 0.5 (g), labeled for the Loma Prieta ground motion, are considered. Four-node meshes are applied to reflect the torsion moments in the steel plate behavior. A multi-objective function, Fisher Information Matrix, is utilized, and four sensor locations are optimized to identify the locations most sensitive to damage. AutoRegressive Moving Average with exogenous input (ARMAX) system identification method is employed to obtain the structural displacement from the acceleration data and, subsequently, the displacement state equations of the nodes. With the aid of the structural displacement and its derivatives obtained through the central finite difference approximation method, damage to the plate structure is detected at PGA = 0.05 (g) and PGA = 0.50 (g) considering thickness changes based on the peak values manifested in the proposed damage detection index. Furthermore, the recorded structural acceleration responses at the desired scales of PGAs are fed into the 2D wavelet transform to detect damage imposed on the plate structure using the diagonal component of the wavelet transform. The results confirm that the proposed nonmodel-based approach successfully detects the single and multiple damage scenarios and can be used for a quick and judicious assessment of the steel plate behavior immediately after damage.},

A thin film sensor composed of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and MXene was developed through simple mixing and spray vacuum filtration. This highly flexible and susceptible MXene/CNT film sensor can be embedded in polymer composites to monitor the phase change of the resin and the determination of the gel point during the preparation of the composite in real-time. The MXene/CNT film sensors were embedded and arrayed in fiber-reinforced composites, which can be used for resin curing monitoring, then continued structural health monitoring. Experimental results show that the MXene/CNT film sensor embedded in the composite laminates can effectively capture the change of the resin phase, that characterized by resistance. MXene/CNT films have a good ability to respond to changes in the resin state. The gel point of resin obtained from the MXene/CNT film sensor is 134 °C, which is consistent with 137 °C from the DMA results. The accurate gel point can optimize the curing system and improve the quality of composite products. Then the tensile, bending, and fatigue tests of fiber-reinforced composite laminates embedded with MXene/CNT film sensors were carried out. MXene/CNT film sensor can keep good response and response consistency for a long time. As a novel sensor, the MXene/CNT film sensor has the advantages of high response sensitivity, solid real-time performance, and long service time. The MXene/CNT film sensor has great potential to establish and optimize manufacturing processes and to improve the cure quality of fiber-based resin composites. This sensor can be used to follow the entire life cycle of a composite from fabrication till end-of-life.},

These structures are subjected to environmental and mechanical loading conditions which leads to structural damage. The damage identification at early stage is crucial to overcome catastrophic failures, economic loss, human loss, and its disastrous consequences. Therefore, various structural damage identification techniques have been developed to identify the structural damages stages. These techniques provide the damage information about the systems, including structural health, serviceability, integrity, and safety. Over the past few decades, several review articles have been published on damage detection methods employing vibration characteristics for conventional and composite structures together. There has not been a study where complete concentration is focused on the laminated composite structures alone. This article concentrates on damage identification of laminated composite structures using vibration-based methods integrated with finite element methods, optimization techniques, signal processing methods, and machine learning algorithms over the past thirteen years. In addition, the limitations and applications of various methods have been discussed. This review article will provide the researchers and engineers an insight into the damage detection methods for laminated composite structures.},

Determining UCS values in laboratory is costly and time consuming, hence, its indirect determination through use of rock index tests is of a great interest and advantage. This study presents a prediction process of the UCS values through the use of three non-destructive tests i.e., p-wave velocity, Schmidt hammer and density. This process was done by developing an intelligent predictive technique namely the group method of data handling (GMDH). Before constructing intelligence system, a series of experimental equations were proposed using three non-destructive tests. The results showed that there is a need to propose new model with taking advantages of all three non-destructive tests results. Then, several GMDH models were built through the use of various parametric studies on the most effective GMDH factors. For comparison purposes, an artificial neural network (ANN) was also modelled to predict rock strength. The obtained results of the ANN and GMDH were assessed based on system error and coefficient of determination values. The results confirmed that the proposed GMDH model is an applicable, powerful, and practical intelligence system that is able to provide an acceptable accuracy level for predicting rock strength.},

The most widely used non-destructive (ND) techniques are rebound hammer and ultrasonic pulse velocity. From the resulting data of NDT and compressive strength test results on specimens, a conversion law is identified which can then be used to estimate the compressive strength at any location in the structure. Since this process is very sensitive to many uncertainty sources, recent RILEM recommendations have revised the assessment paradigm by considering it in a probabilistic framework. The challenge is no longer to estimate the true concrete strength, but to limit the risk of a wrong estimation within a certain admissible interval. In this context, it is shown how synthetic simulations are used to capture the main features of this problem and are a firm basis for justifying the relationship between the most influencing parameters and the quality of the assessment. In addition, the effect of conditional coring, which consists in the selection of coring positions on the basis of previous NDT results, is highlighted and quantified. Finally, the methodology that makes possible to define the required number of cores for a given target accuracy is presented.},

Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are three widely-used methods for BTS prediction. This study investigated the performance of these three intelligent models for BTS forecasting. In this regard, three non-destructive tests, namely Schmidt hammer, p-wave velocity, and density, were performed on 127 granitic rock samples, and their results were considered as input parameters. Then, the BTS tests were carried out on the samples and their results were considered as model output. Four measures of coefficient of determination (R2), Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Scatter index (SI) were used for evaluation. The results showed that the ANFIS model, which is enjoying advantages of both ANN and FIS models, provides more accurate results in comparison with the proposed ANN and FIS models in predicting BTS values. R2 values for ANFIS, ANN, and FIS models were 0.92, 0.88, and 0.87, respectively. Besides, the ANFIS model could yield the lowest RMSE value of 81.5\%, whereas RMSEs for FIS and ANN were 89.5\% and 87.5\%, respectively.},

The results showed that the water absorption capacity and water absorption coefficient by capillarity values decreased while the hardened composite density values increased as the basalt fiber ratio increased in the mixtures. The maximum ultrasonic pulse velocity values were obtained from P0B100 (consisting of only 100\% basalt fiber) samples with the highest Schmidt rebound hammer values of 4.11 km/s and 32, respectively.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of high-temperature damaged concrete is crucial to ensure the safety of any structure after a fire event. However, using destructive tests, such as taking cores from the concrete, can be costly and dangerous; specifically for damaged structures. Therefore, it is preferred to use in-situ non-destructive testing (NDT) in the assessment of damaged concrete. The objective of this study is to develop an artificial neural network model, based on destructive and non-destructive testing results, to assess the concrete strength after being subjected to high-temperature levels; without the need for further in-situ destructive testing. The effect of high-temperature levels (200–800 °C) on concrete compressive strength was investigated in this study using destructive compression and non-destructive tests on concrete cubes; including ultrasonic pulse velocity and Schmidt rebound hammer testing methods. The results of destructive and non-destructive tests of damaged and undamaged concrete were found to be highly correlated. Therefore, the data of this study and data obtained from the cited literature were augmented together and used to optimise and train the artificial neural network model. The artificial neural network analysis indicated that concrete compressive strength (CS), the magnitude of high-temperature damage, and the level of exposure temperature can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using only a combination of non-destructive tests results. The model had a coefficient of determination equals to 0.944.},

The effect of various temperatures on compressive strength properties was assessed. The cubes were exposed to temperature ranging from 50 to 70 °C for a duration ranging from 2 to 10 h, and the compressive strength of the specimens was analyzed for destructive and non-destructive analysis and tested for 7, 28, and 90 days. The obtained compressive strength (CS) results were analyzed employing the probability plot (PP) curve, distribution overview curve (DOC), probability density function (PDF), Weibull, survival, and hazard function curve. Maximum compressive strength was achieved for the temperature of 70 °C and an A/B of 0.45 for destructive tests and non-destructive tests with 44.6 MPa and 43.56 MPa, respectively, on 90 days of testing. The survival and hazard function curves showed incremental distribution characteristics for 28 and 90 days of testing results with a probability factor ranging from 0.8 to 1.0.},

For this purpose, a sum of 274 datasets was compiled and used to train and validate three ANN models including ANN constructed using Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (ANN-LM), a combination of ANN and particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO), and a combination of ANN and imperialist competitive algorithm (ANN-ICA). The constructed ANN-LM model was proven to be the most accurate based on experimental findings. In the validation phase, the ANN-LM model has achieved the best predictive performance with R = 0.9607 and RMSE = 14.8272. Experimental results show that the developed ANN-LM outperforms a number of existing models available in the literature. Furthermore, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been developed which can be readily used to estimate the UCS of granite through the ANN-LM model. The developed GUI is made available as a supplementary material.},

Piers were aged by using an imposed electric current and sodium chloride water solution before performing a mechanical cyclic-load test. The corrosion process has been detected with Non-Destructive Evaluation techniques by means of SonReb method (to check concrete degradation) and by measuring corrosion potential (to check steel degradation). The crack pattern was recorded by dedicated cameras, and an LVDT system was set up to monitor the cyclic-load test. Experimental results focused on degradation monitoring and mechanical performance under cyclic loads. During the cyclic-load mechanical test, the first cracks on the piers surface occurred diagonally, inclined at about 45°. This is the consequence of the failure mode change from ductile failure, as expected for slender designed piers, to brittle shear failure. The flexural failure occurred in the case of non-corroded piers. Presented tests can provide a useful contribution of experimental data to analyse the behaviour of corroded reinforced concrete hollow bridge piers, scarcely tested. In particular, the cyclic response can be a useful reference for the proposition/validation of nonlinear capacity models for the evaluation of the seismic capacity of corroded bridge piers.},

	abstract = {One of the most significant and critical urban assets for a sustainable community is the sewer pipeline network and water distribution system. Water sewer networks and distribution systems have a definite service life span to provide continuous facilities to end users. Therefore, it is pertinent to continuously evaluate the condition of water and sewer concrete pipelines to ensure the reliable, sustainable, and cost-efficient transport of water and sewerage for the safety of society. The condition assessment is commonly carried out by visual observations followed by some non-destructive testing methods. However, it is the need of the hour to shift assessment methods to advance assessment techniques to save time and money for our community. Currently, in this project, the condition assessment of pre-cast concrete pipes was carried out by destructive and non-destructive methods. Different test trials i.e., ultra-sonic pulse velocity, Schmidt hammer also known as rebound hammer test, visual inspection, three edge bearing test, and core cutting test on the old buried and new concrete pipes were performed. It was observed that concrete used for the construction of existing precast concrete pipes still has better quality indices after 20 years as compared to that of concrete of new pipes. However, steel has deteriorated with time and clear corrosion of steel was identified in existing pre-cast concrete pipes. At the same time, it was observed that there should be an automated mechanism to continuously asses the condition of pre-cast existing pipes which will address the sustainable development goals (SDG 6, 9, 11). Consequently, it can be said that condition assessment of pre-cast concrete pipes will lead to sustainable societies and infrastructure.},

The industrial grade and commercially available Non-Destructive Test (NDT) measurement instrument based on the impulse excitation technique is meanwhile expensive. This project involves designing and developing a low-cost NDT system for the measurement of elastic modulus based on the impulse excitation technique. Secondly, it is to compare the performance of the measurement system with the tensile test. The performance of the NDT prototype will be put to test by using different type of specimens such as aluminium alloy, copper, brass, and carbon steel. Each type of specimen will carry be tested three times to get the average of the data. After all the data collection of the NDT measurement system, the tensile test will be carried out. A comparison for the measurement of the elastic modulus will be conducted between the NDT system, tensile test, and theoretical results. The expected outcome for this project is to develop a NDT for the measurement of the elastic modulus. This project also aims to reduce the industrial waste, reduce the cost of the sample test and maintain the accuracy and the performance of the NDT system compared with the tensile test.},

	abstract = {The utilization of waste fly ash and natural jute fiber has drawn attention to producing sustainable concrete. However, there is a lack of studies to analyze the synergistic effect of jute fiber and fly ash on the properties of concrete. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the combined effect of fly ash concentration and the different sizes of jute fiber on the fresh, hardened, and non-destructive testing properties of concrete. Concerning the purpose, the concrete mixes were prepared with 0.2 \% and 0.4 \% jute fiber incorporating 0 \%, 5 \%, 10 \%, and 15 \% replacement of cement by fly ash in concrete. For the assessment of properties, slump, density, and compacting factor test was conducted at the fresh state of concrete, whereas mechanical properties such as compressive, splitting tensile, and flexure strength test were conducted at 7 and 28 days. In addition, the non-destructive test (NDT) was also carried out to predict the destructive compressive strength by rebound hammer at 28 days. The microstructure property of optimum mix concrete was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is observed that the incorporation of jute fiber decreased the slump, density, and compacting factor but increased the compressive, splitting tensile, and flexure strength, whereas the fly ash improved both fresh and hardened properties. Compared to the standard mix, fly ash-based JFRC mixtures have compressive strength improvements varying from 1.7 \% to 25.9 \%. The 10 \% fly ash and 0.2 \% volume of jute fiber exhibited a maximum of 11.64 \% and 10.72 \% splitting tensile and flexural strength enhancement at 28 days, respecting the control mix. In addition, the NDT strength assessment obtained 5.5 \% less than destructive strength on average. From the SEM point of view, it is obtained that the 10 \% fly ash with 0.2 \% jute fiber composition matrix exhibits a better bonding interface and the cracking resistance nature of the concrete mix.},
