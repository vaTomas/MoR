   abstract = {This article presents a concise review of modern non-destructive testing (NDT) methods that allow the detection, tracking, and measurement of cracks in reinforced concrete structures. Over the past decades, the range of solutions available on the market has increased. This provides excellent opportunities when choosing and designing systems for diagnosing and continuously monitoring structures. Cracking affects the mechanical properties, durability, and serviceability of a structure or its elements. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that would allow the determination of the moment of a destructive process’s formation, i.e., a crack’s appearance. At the same time, it is crucial to be able to track the development of cracks for the entire structure, not just selected locations. This work also presents the concept of combining selected NDT methods and creating a system for the continuous monitoring of structural integrity and predicting changes in the durability of existing and future buildings.},

The behaviour of a reinforced concrete structure subjected to operational changes is considered. The changes/damage detection procedure is based on a novel sensor fusion method. Several advantages of the proposed approach using the sensor fusion method with respect to features from single pair of sensors were shown and discussed based on the tested objects. A CWT feature-based approach is considered to extract damage-sensitive features. Experimental results using the proposed approach show a probability of detection greater than 94% when detecting cracks due to quasistatic load. Due to the comprehensive effectiveness and low computational complexity, the proposed approach could be performed in large real structural damage assessment problems as well.},

Revit parametric families allowed the creation of complex curved elements such as vaults and 3D geometrical models of the church based on a hybrid point cloud. The onsite survey results indicated that the main anomalies correspond to the presence of biological agents and cracking. In contrast, NDT allowed the estimation of the masonry material properties and the modal identification primarily of the towers. Finally, the application of pushover analyses allowed the estimation of the structure's maximum load capacity and post-peak behavoir. It was possible to determine that some collapse mechanisms (overturning of main façade and bell towers, and the generation of hinges in curved elements) can be activated in medium-strong earthquakes.},

   abstract = {The application of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials in concrete structures has been rising due to their several advantages, including lightweight, high tensile strength, ease of installation, and corrosion resistance. They have been mostly implemented for strengthening and repairing existing structures in the form of an externally bonded system, i.e., sheet, jacket, near surface mounted. Furthermore, they have been recently utilized as internal reinforcement of concrete elements in the form of bars, meshes and tendons. Although higher durability and performance are associated with the FRP as compared to steel, this fact does not exclude the possibility of damages and defects, many of which are related to their unique features. For example, debonding of FRP materials from a concrete surface or within a concrete element has occurred and needs to be corrected to avoid the premature failure of a structure. To this end, concrete elements reinforced or strengthened with FRP materials (FRP-RSC) should be inspected periodically to detect potential problems and hence prevent premature failures. This study first determines possible or potential damages and anomalies attributed to FRP-RSC elements. It then investigates Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods that can be applicable to the inspection of FRP reinforced/strengthened concrete elements from a literature survey of past studies, applications, and research projects. Finally, it proposes the most promising methods for detecting FRP and their damage/defects in FRP-RSC elements. By providing the inspection community with more clarity in the application of NDT to FRP, the results of this study offer means for verifying the performance and, therefore, help the proliferation of FRP materials in concrete structures.},

Such a prediction is usually performed based on experimental destructive testing on specimens, which often does not reflect the geometrical complexity of a component with damage, or based on numerical simulations, which are difficult to parametrize due to the complexity of fracture mechanisms of composite materials. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid methodology based on evaluation of results of the ultrasonic non-destructive testing technique supported with numerical modeling and compression after impact (CAI) tests to evaluate residual strength of glass- and carbon-reinforced polymer composite structures. Based on ultrasonic C-scans processing and incorporation of impact damage shapes in numerical models and further evaluation of the obtained results in the light of CAI tests, the model for the prediction of residual strength in composites was developed.},

   abstract = {The rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks that initiate from the surface of ferromagnetic materials in aviation bearings and high-speed rails are typically inclined at varying angles, posing a serious threat to safety. Therefore, a rapid and quantitative characterization of inclined cracks is of great importance. This paper investigates the distribution of magnetic fields and motion-induced eddy current (MIEC) in direct current (DC) electromagnetic non-destructive testing (NDT), and proposes an approach for measuring the direction of RCF cracks in moving ferromagnetic materials. The magnetic field and MIEC distributions in the moving ferromagnetic material are initially investigated, followed by a numerical simulation exploring the impact of crack inclination angle and depth on detection signals. The resulting relationship between crack propagation angle, depth, and detection signal is then obtained. Furthermore, a DC electromagnetic NDT platform has been designed and a quantitative detection approach for inclined cracks has been proposed and validated through experiments. Finally, a real scenario detection is carried out. The investigation presented in this paper demonstrates that the DC electromagnetic NDT technique is applicable not only for assessment RCF crack direction in moving ferromagnetic materials, such as rotating aviation bearings, but also for characterizing inclined cracks under conditions of fast relative motion between the probe and the ferromagnetic material (e.g., high-speed rail, pipeline, etc.).},

   abstract = {This paper presents a methodology of digital shearography for determining the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth under different loading magnitudes for the purpose of nondestructive testing. Digital Shearography, an interferometric nondestructive testing (NDT) technique, has been proven to be a useful tool for material inspections and evaluations, especially for detecting delaminations/disbonds in composite materials and honeycomb structures. A commonly asked question in the field of NDT is about measuring sensitivity - specifically, what is the smallest detectable delamination/disbond and how deep can these be detected? Although various attempts to find the smallest detectable defect by shearography have been made, a numerical model for determining the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth has not yet been developed. This paper did a study in this aspect, especially for NDT of delamination and disbond in polymers and honeycomb structures. First, a mechanical model based on the thin plate theory to calculate the expected bending of close-to-surface defects was proposed; the model built a relationship among the deformation caused by a defect, the size and the depth of the defect, as well as the load and the material properties. Second, the relationship between the relative deformation measured by shearography and the deformation induced by a defect was established based on the optimized shearing amount and the sensitivity of digital shearography. Based on these analyses, relationships between the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth under different load amounts were established for different defect shapes. Finally, experimental validation based on different sizes of prefabricated defects were conducted to verify these relationships. The experimental results show that the model developed can provide useful estimation for NDT by digital shearography, especially with helping test engineers estimate the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth with corresponding loading magnitudes.},

Therefore, they have long been regarded as an ideal sensing solution for SHM. In this review, the different optical fiber technologies used for ultrasonic sensing are discussed in detail. Special attention has been given to the new developments in the use of FBG sensors for ultrasonic measurements, as they are the most promising and widely used of the sensors. The paper highlights the physics of the wave coupling to the optical fiber and explains the different phenomena such as directional sensitivity and directional coupling of the wave. Applications of the different sensors in real SHM applications have also been discussed.

This work presents a sensing concept based on guided electromagnetic waves (GEW), in which the waveguide forms a union with the structure to be inspected. Exploiting ultra-wideband signals a surface defect in the area under the waveguide can be detected and accurately localized. This paper presents numerical and experimental GEW results for a straight waveguide focusing on the detection of through holes and cracks with different orientation. It was found that the numerical model qualitatively replicates the experimental S-parameter measurements for holes of different diameters. A parametric numerical study indicates that the crack parameters such as its orientation and width has a significant influence on the interaction of the incident wave with the structural defect. On top, a numerical study is performed for complex-shaped rectangular waveguides including several waveguide bends. Besides a successful damage detection, the damage position can also be precisely determined with a maximum localization error of less than 3%.},

   abstract = {<p> Detection of mechanical damage using Lamb or Rayleigh waves is limited to relatively simple geometries, yet real structures often incorporate features such as free or clamped edges, welds, rivets, ribs and holes. All these features are potential sources of wave reflections and scattering, which make the application of these types of guided waves for damage detection difficult. However, these features can themselves generate so-called ‘feature-guided’ waves. This article details the first application of the fundamental mode of transient edge waves for detection of mechanical damage. The fundamental edge wave mode (ES <sub>0</sub> ) – a natural analogue to Rayleigh waves – is weakly dispersive and may decay with propagation distance. The phase and group velocities of the ES <sub>0</sub> wave mode are close to the fundamental shear horizontal (SH <sub>0</sub> ) and symmetric Lamb (S <sub>0</sub> ) wave modes, at low and high frequencies, respectively. It is therefore quite challenging to excite a single ES <sub>0</sub> mode and avoid wave coupling. However, it was found experimentally that at medium range frequencies the ES <sub>0</sub> mode can be decoupled from SH <sub>0</sub> and S <sub>0</sub> modes, and its decay is small, allowing for distant detection of defects and damage along free edges of slender structural components. This article provides a brief theory of edge waves, excitation methodology and successful examples of distant detection of crack-like and corrosion damage in I-beam sections, which are widely applied in engineering and construction. </p>},

A straightforward and efficient enhancement method based on multi-grayscale fusion and edge-weight is proposed to improve the quality of X-ray images. This approach makes use of several established image processing techniques. First, multiple derived images with various grayscales are obtained using three contrast adjustment techniques. The Laplacian pyramid, Gaussian-weighted pyramid, and principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm are then utilized to create a fusion image that displays overall structural information. The bilateral and guided filters are employed to generate an edge-weighted image that contains a lot of edge information. Finally, the edge-weighted image is performed by an exponential operation on the fusion image to obtain a high-contrast image, which is crucial to enhance the detailed features of the image. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method beats previous comparison algorithms in the quantitative index and is capable of fully presenting the internal structures of the samples. Additionally, the enhanced image is satisfactory in detail enhancement, local contrast improvement, and visual sensation.},

To operate them on a wider scale, reducing maintenance life-cycle costs while ensuring their integrity is essential. Autonomous operations in advanced nuclear reactors using augmented Digital Twin (DT) technology can serve as a cost-effective solution by increasing awareness about the system’s health. A key component of nuclear DT frameworks is the condition monitoring of safety systems, such as piping-equipment systems, which involves acquiring and monitoring the plant’s sensor data. This research proposes a condition monitoring methodology utilizing deep learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptions (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect degradation and its severity in nuclear piping-equipment systems. Sensor signals are processed to obtain the power spectral density and the Short-Time Fourier transform, and feature extraction methodologies are proposed to develop degradation-sensitive data repositories. The performance of MLP, one-dimensional (1D) CNN, and 2D CNN within the proposed condition monitoring framework is compared using a finite element model of a 3D piping system subjected to seismic loads as the application case study. Various approaches, such as dropout, k-Fold validation, regularization, and early stopping of training the network, are investigated to avoid overfitting the models to the input sensor data. The predictive capability and computational capacity of the deep learning algorithms are also compared to detect degradation in the Z-pipe system of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBRII). The Z-pipe system is subjected to harmonic excitations that represent normal operating loads, such as pump-induced vibrations. The findings of the study indicate that the proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-driven condition monitoring framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracies with a 2D CNN, whereas the MLP exhibits higher computational efficiency.},

   abstract = {<p>In a highly competitive and demanding microelectronics market, non-destructive testing (NDT) technology has been widely applied to defect detection and evaluation of microelectronic packaging. However, the trend of microelectronic packaging toward miniaturization, high-density, ultra-thin, ultra-light and with small chip footprint, poses an urgent demand for novel NDT methods with high-resolution and large penetration depth, which is utilized for internal defect detection and identification of advanced complicated packages. The conventional NDT methods for microelectronic packaging mainly include optical visual inspection, X-ray inspection, active infrared thermography, scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser Doppler vibration measuring technique, scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and so on. This paper aims to provide a review of addressing their basic principles, advantages, limitations and application researches in the field of defect inspection of microelectronic packaging. Moreover, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing NDT methods, this paper emphasizes a novel NDT approach, called hybrid ultrasonic-laser digital holographic microscopy (DHM) imaging inspection method, and discusses its basic principle, merits, key techniques, system construction and experimental results in detail. When some key technical problems can be solved in further research, this method will become a potentially promising technique for defect detection and evaluation of advanced complicated packages.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Silicone rubber insulators (SRIs) are widely used in high-voltage power grids. Due to high-voltage fields and harsh environmental conditions, SRIs eventually deteriorate with use in the power grid, decreasing their insulating performance and operational life and contributing to transmission line failures. Therefore, quantitatively assessing the aging status of SRIs is crucial. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the magnetic resonance method for assessing the age of SRIs at the level of chemical structure; we built and made a portable magnetic resonance sensor, and evaluated the sensor’s functionality. By measuring the SRI sheds at various service times, it was discovered that the equivalent transverse relaxation time, T2eff, can describe the degree of aging of the SRIs. The results of the magnetic resonance measurements were also compared with those of the static contact angle method, and the two measurement methods yielded the same conclusions. However, the magnetic resonance method was more sensitive than the one using the static contact angle method.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The growing population and increasing demand for surface transportation have highlighted the importance of maintaining safe and reliable civil infrastructures for daily use. Among all civil infrastructures, bridges are one of the most important elements in the transportation system. As such, to prevent any failures caused by aging and environmental impacts, bridges require periodic inspections. This becomes even more critical due to climate change and its effect on bridges, especially in the coastal regions. Most of the inspections conducted incorporate the visual type of evaluation due to its simplicity. However, with the current developments in new technologies, there is a need for more advanced techniques of structural health monitoring (SHM) methods to be incorporated in the maintenance programs for more accurate and efficient surveys. In this paper, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods applicable to steel bridges are reviewed, with a focus on methods applicable to local damage detection. Moreover, the methodology, advantages and disadvantages, and up-to-date research on NDT methods are presented. Furthermore, the application of novel NDT techniques using innovative sensors, drones, and robots for the rapid and efficient assessment of damages on small and large scales is emphasized. This study is deemed necessary as it compiles in one place the available information regarding NDT methods for in-service steel bridges. Access to such information is critical for researchers who intend to work on new or improved NDT techniques.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>With the increased use of composites in aircraft, many new successful contributions to the advancement of the structural health monitoring (SHM) field for composite aerospace structures have been achieved. Yet its application is still not often seen in operational conditions in the aircraft industry, mostly due to a gap between research focus and application, which constraints the shift towards improved aircraft maintenance strategies such as condition-based maintenance (CBM). In this work, we identify and highlight two key facets involved in the maturing of the SHM field for composite aircraft structures: (1) the aircraft maintenance engineer who requires a holistic damage assessment for the aircraft’s structural health management, and (2) the upscaling of the SHM application to realistic composite aircraft structures under in-service conditions. Multi-sensor data fusion concepts can aid in addressing these aspects and we formulate its benefits, opportunities, and challenges. Additionally, for demonstration purposes, we show a conceptual design study for a fusion-based SHM system for multi-level damage monitoring of a representative composite aircraft wing structure. In this manner, we present how multi-sensor data fusion concepts can be of benefit to the community in advancing the field of SHM for composite aircraft structures towards an operational CBM application in the aircraft industry.</p>},

However, their main limitation, due to big data or high-dimensional features, is linked to the complex and time-consuming procedures for feature extraction and/or statistical decision-making. To cope with this issue, in this article we propose a strategy based on autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling for feature extraction, and on an innovative hybrid divergence-based method for feature classification. Data relevant to a cable-stayed bridge are accounted for to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the offered hybrid divergence-based method, in conjunction with ARMA modeling, succeeds in detecting damage in cases strongly characterized by big data.</p>},
