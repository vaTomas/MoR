The latest generation of smartphones, tablets and wearables play a key role in advancing technological avenues, in providing higher flexibility, and in improving productivity levels. Opportunities arising from the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are getting understood and embraced by virtually all industries today, and by more and more companies. These opportunities are also finding their way into the manual ultrasonic Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) market. Frequently found roadblocks to the uptake of such powerful and versatile digital platforms in NDT are found to be • regulations, e.g. usage of wireless data transmission in oil & gas (O&G), • restrictive company rules, e.g. companies blocking smartphones or cameras, • long standing and user habits, e.g. maintaining inefficient outdated workflows, • fear of external data storage, e.g. blocking cloud-based backup solutions. To overcome these and expedite the digital transformation in the NDT markets, NDT supplier companies need to take the efforts to illustrate the huge number of advantages that the combination of NDT and digitalization yield. On examples from various industries, inefficiencies in ultrasonic NDT workflows will be identified, and faster, more flexible, lower cost, and higher quality testing solutions will be suggested. The authors will illustrate how users have achieved tremendous benefits from using IoT-based solutions. Based on these case studies, the attractiveness of the business case for investments in digital infrastructure and IoT in NDT applications will be clearly shown, and evidence of savings by using novel solutions will be provided.","2018-08","2024-02-21 13:47:34","2024-02-21 13:47:34","","","","8","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They have been mostly implemented for strengthening and repairing existing structures in the form of an externally bonded system, i.e., sheet, jacket, near surface mounted. Furthermore, they have been recently utilized as internal reinforcement of concrete elements in the form of bars, meshes and tendons. Although higher durability and performance are associated with the FRP as compared to steel, this fact does not exclude the possibility of damages and defects, many of which are related to their unique features. For example, debonding of FRP materials from a concrete surface or within a concrete element has occurred and needs to be corrected to avoid the premature failure of a structure. To this end, concrete elements reinforced or strengthened with FRP materials (FRP-RSC) should be inspected periodically to detect potential problems and hence prevent premature failures. This study first determines possible or potential damages and anomalies attributed to FRP-RSC elements.

Therefore, a rapid and quantitative characterization of inclined cracks is of great importance. This paper investigates the distribution of magnetic fields and motion-induced eddy current (MIEC) in direct current (DC) electromagnetic non-destructive testing (NDT), and proposes an approach for measuring the direction of RCF cracks in moving ferromagnetic materials. The magnetic field and MIEC distributions in the moving ferromagnetic material are initially investigated, followed by a numerical simulation exploring the impact of crack inclination angle and depth on detection signals. The resulting relationship between crack propagation angle, depth, and detection signal is then obtained. Furthermore, a DC electromagnetic NDT platform has been designed and a quantitative detection approach for inclined cracks has been proposed and validated through experiments. Finally, a real scenario detection is carried out. The investigation presented in this paper demonstrates that the DC electromagnetic NDT technique is applicable not only for assessment RCF crack direction in moving ferromagnetic materials, such as rotating aviation bearings, but also for characterizing inclined cracks under conditions of fast relative motion between the probe and the ferromagnetic material (e.g., high-speed rail, pipeline, etc.).","2023-09","2024-02-21 13:47:34","2024-02-21 13:47:34","","","","","138","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Electromagnetic nondestructive testing; Ferromagnetic material; Motion-induced eddy currents; Rolling contact fatigue cracks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital Shearography, an interferometric nondestructive testing (NDT) technique, has been proven to be a useful tool for material inspections and evaluations, especially for detecting delaminations/disbonds in composite materials and honeycomb structures. A commonly asked question in the field of NDT is about measuring sensitivity - specifically, what is the smallest detectable delamination/disbond and how deep can these be detected? Although various attempts to find the smallest detectable defect by shearography have been made, a numerical model for determining the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth has not yet been developed. This paper did a study in this aspect, especially for NDT of delamination and disbond in polymers and honeycomb structures. First, a mechanical model based on the thin plate theory to calculate the expected bending of close-to-surface defects was proposed; the model built a relationship among the deformation caused by a defect, the size and the depth of the defect, as well as the load and the material properties. Second, the relationship between the relative deformation measured by shearography and the deformation induced by a defect was established based on the optimized shearing amount and the sensitivity of digital shearography. Based on these analyses, relationships between the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth under different load amounts were established for different defect shapes. Finally, experimental validation based on different sizes of prefabricated defects were conducted to verify these relationships. The experimental results show that the model developed can provide useful estimation for NDT by digital shearography, especially with helping test engineers estimate the size of the smallest detectable defect and the depth with corresponding loading magnitudes.","2023-10","2024-02-21 13:47:34","2024-02-21 13:47:34","","","","","139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Digital shearography; Effect of defect depth; Effect of defect shape; Impact of loading magnitude; NDT; The smallest detectable size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploiting ultra-wideband signals a surface defect in the area under the waveguide can be detected and accurately localized. This paper presents numerical and experimental GEW results for a straight waveguide focusing on the detection of through holes and cracks with different orientation. It was found that the numerical model qualitatively replicates the experimental S-parameter measurements for holes of different diameters.

All these features are potential sources of wave reflections and scattering, which make the application of these types of guided waves for damage detection difficult. However, these features can themselves generate so-called ‘feature-guided’ waves. This article details the first application of the fundamental mode of transient edge waves for detection of mechanical damage. The fundamental edge wave mode (ES <sub>0</sub> ) – a natural analogue to Rayleigh waves – is weakly dispersive and may decay with propagation distance. The phase and group velocities of the ES <sub>0</sub> wave mode are close to the fundamental shear horizontal (SH <sub>0</sub> ) and symmetric Lamb (S <sub>0</sub> ) wave modes, at low and high frequencies, respectively. It is therefore quite challenging to excite a single ES <sub>0</sub> mode and avoid wave coupling. However, it was found experimentally that at medium range frequencies the ES <sub>0</sub> mode can be decoupled from SH <sub>0</sub> and S <sub>0</sub> modes, and its decay is small, allowing for distant detection of defects and damage along free edges of slender structural components. This article provides a brief theory of edge waves, excitation methodology and successful examples of distant detection of crack-like and corrosion damage in I-beam sections, which are widely applied in engineering and construction. </p>","2021-01","2024-02-21 13:47:34","2024-02-21 13:47:34","","74-83","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To operate them on a wider scale, reducing maintenance life-cycle costs while ensuring their integrity is essential. Autonomous operations in advanced nuclear reactors using augmented Digital Twin (DT) technology can serve as a cost-effective solution by increasing awareness about the system’s health. A key component of nuclear DT frameworks is the condition monitoring of safety systems, such as piping-equipment systems, which involves acquiring and monitoring the plant’s sensor data. This research proposes a condition monitoring methodology utilizing deep learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptions (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect degradation and its severity in nuclear piping-equipment systems. Sensor signals are processed to obtain the power spectral density and the Short-Time Fourier transform, and feature extraction methodologies are proposed to develop degradation-sensitive data repositories. The performance of MLP, one-dimensional (1D) CNN, and 2D CNN within the proposed condition monitoring framework is compared using a finite element model of a 3D piping system subjected to seismic loads as the application case study. Various approaches, such as dropout, k-Fold validation, regularization, and early stopping of training the network, are investigated to avoid overfitting the models to the input sensor data. The predictive capability and computational capacity of the deep learning algorithms are also compared to detect degradation in the Z-pipe system of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBRII). The Z-pipe system is subjected to harmonic excitations that represent normal operating loads, such as pump-induced vibrations.

The Lamb wave, as an ultrasonic guided wave propagating in plate-like structures, is an effective tool for fault diagnosis. The Capon method is widely used in Lamb wave based damage imaging due to its superior performance in suppressing background noise compared with the conventional delay-and-sum method. As the conventional Capon method is sensitive to modeling errors like the inaccuracy of the look-direction, diagonal loading is usually adopted to regularize the inverse of the covariance matrix. However, the degree of diagonal loading is related to the accuracy of the given look-direction and is hard to determine accurately. Aimed at improving the imaging quality of the conventional Capon method, an adaptive Capon method with adaptive diagonal loading is proposed. In the proposed method, the dispersion and the amplitude caused by wave diffusion are first compensated for each imaging point using the virtual time reversal technique. The correlations among the compensated waveforms after windowing are used to determine the degree of diagonal loading. In the process of regularizing the inverse of the covariance matrix, a large diagonal loading factor will be applied when the correlations among the compensated waveforms are large. As correlations are closely related to the signal phase, both the amplitude and the phase of scattering signals are utilized in the proposed method. The numerical and experimental validations on an aluminum plate are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that compared with the conventional Capon method, the proposed method can obtain images with higher imaging quality, fewer artifacts, and lower noise.","2023-09","2024-02-21 13:59:06","2024-02-21 13:59:06","2024-02-21 13:59:06","125406","","12","34","","Meas.

The team recently reported that impulse dynamic tests can promote the local resonances in rails up to 40 kHz, and the results were verified using both semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) analysis and frequency-domain fully discretized finite element analysis. In this work, we present the discovery of ZGV modes and cutoff frequency resonances in free rails up to 80 kHz using piezoelectric elements. A miniature low-cost PZT patch works as a consistent excitation source compared with the impulse dynamic testing method. First, we implement the SAFE analysis to compute dispersion curves of a standard AREMA 115RE rail and to identify potential ZGV and cutoff frequency points up to 80 kHz. Then, to understand the existence and detectability of identified ZGV and cutoff points in a free rail, we install one PZT patch on the side of the rail head. A chirp signal covering 20 to 120 kHz is selected as the excitation to cover the desired frequency range. Finally, we perform a spatial sampling of wave propagation using three receivers along the wave propagation direction to calculate the dispersion relations experimentally via two-dimensional Fourier Transforms (2D-FFT).

However, the use of a piezoelectric sensor's network to locate and image damaged areas in composite structures requires a number of precautions including the consideration of anisotropy and baseline signals. The lack of information related to these two parameters drastically deteriorates the imaging performance of numerous signal processing methods. To avoid such deterioration, the present contribution proposes different methods to build baseline signals in different types of composites. Baseline signals are first constructed from a numerical simulation model using the previously determined elasticity tensor of the structure. Since the latter tensor is not always easy to obtain especially in the case of anisotropic materials, a second PZT network is used in order to obtain signals related to Lamb waves propagating in different directions. Waveforms are then translated according to a simplified theoretical propagation model of Lamb waves in homogeneous structures. The application of the different methods on transversely isotropic, unidirectional and quasi-transversely isotropic composites allows to have satisfactory images that well represent the damaged areas with the help of the delay-and-sum algorithm.","2023-04-28","2024-02-21 14:00:40","2024-02-21 14:00:40","","4368","","9","23","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37177588 PMCID: PMC10181622","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\95N462RU\Nzouatchoua et al. - 2023 - Damage Localization on Composite Structures Based .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37177588","","anisotropic composite structures; delay-and-sum; impact damage; Lamb waves; PZT network; structural health monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the SRM health status, and the existing nondestructive testing technology and the designed optical fiber sensor cannot meet the monitoring requirements. In order to solve this problem, this paper uses femtosecond laser direct writing technology to write high contrast short femtosecond grating array. A new packaging method is proposed to enable the sensor array to measure 9000 με. It solves the grating chirp phenomenon caused by stress concentration in the SRM, and breaks through the key technology of fiber optic sensor implantation in the SRM. The shell pressure test and strain monitoring inside the SRM during long-term storage are realized. For the first time, the experiments of tearing and shearing specimens were simulated. Compared with the results of computed tomography, it proves the accuracy and progressiveness of implantable optical fiber sensing technology.

As the failure mechanisms of these materials are complex, damage detection becomes challenging, requiring advanced techniques for assessing structural integrity and maintaining aircraft safety. In this context, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) seeks for integrating sensors into the structures in a way that Nondestructive Testing (NDT) is implemented continuously. One promising approach is to use Fiber Optic Sensors (FOS) to acquire strain signals, taking advantages of their capabilities over conventional sensors. Despite several works have developed Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) using FOS for performing in-flight SHM in aircraft structures, automatic damage detection using the acquired signals has not been achieved in a robust way against environmental and operational variability, in all flight stages or considering different types of damages. In this work, a HUMS was developed and implemented in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on 20 Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) embedded into the composite front spar of the aircraft’s wing, a miniaturized data acquisition subsystem for gathering strain signals and a wireless transmission subsystem for remote sensing. The HUMS was tested in 16 flights, six of them were carried out with the pristine structure and the remaining after inducing different artificial damages. The in-flight data were used to validate a previously developed damage detection methodology based on strain field pattern recognition, or strain mapping, which utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based procedure for clustering operational conditions and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in conjunction with damage indices for final classification. The performance of the damage detection demonstrated a highest accuracy of 0.981 and a highest F1 score of 0.978.

As a promising nondestructive testing method, the electromechanical impedance (EMI) method has been widely applied in the field of structure health monitoring (SHM) in civil engineering. In this study, this method was explored in monitoring the stiffness degradation of hardened cement paste subjected to compression loadings. Based on the theoretical modelling, a simplified one-dimensional analytical model was established based upon the piezo-elasticity theory to interpret the correlation between the PZT transducer and the cement specimen in the presence of uniaxial compression loading. Moreover, by embedding the PZT transducer inside cement specimens, the conductance signatures in two different frequency ranges throughout the entire loading process were captured and analyzed. It is revealed that the trend of the EMI spectra is compatible with the cement deterioration. More importantly, the resonance frequency and the statistic metric correlation coefficient (CC) can serve as good indicators to quantitatively assess the stiffness degradation of cement paste under uniaxial compression loadings. This research well validates the effectiveness and applicability of the EMI method in real-time monitoring of cement stiffness degradation under compression loadings.","2020-09-30","2024-02-21 14:03:25","2024-02-21 14:03:25","2024-02-21 14:03:25","119395","","","256","","Construction and Building Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\RHUNZS8F\S0950061820314008.html","","","Cementitious material; Electromechanical impedance (EMI); Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT); Secant modulus; Stiffness degradation; Uniaxial compression testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHM is performed acquiring the electrical capacitance variation of the embedded transducers. To study the potential links between the in-situ capacitance signal and the global response of the loaded host specimens, a multi-instrumentation composed of external Nondestructive Testing techniques was implemented on the surfaces of the specimens to search for multi-physical couplings between these external measurements and the capacitance curves.

However, the baselines are unavoidably influenced by operational and environmental conditions leads to an increased error during inspection. To deal with this issue, this paper presents a base-line free method based on the mode conversion and reciprocity principle of Lamb wave. Once the defect is asymmetrical with respect to the transducer pair (two identical piezoelectric transducers used as actuator and receiver respectively), the elastic wave path length of the converted mode will be different, resulting in failing of the reciprocity principle. By processing the signals received by the transducer pair and extracting the time parameters of the wave packets in mode conversion signals, the defect can be localized. Results from the signals generated by numerical simulation are presented to verify the feasibility of the method, and the effectiveness of the proposed baseline-free method is demonstrated with experimental results.","2020-03","2024-02-21 14:03:32","2024-02-21 14:03:32","","106063","","","102","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31955816","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31955816","","Base-line free; Defect localization; Guided wave; Mode conversion; Reciprocity principle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These structures, mostly made of masonry, are difficult to assess due to the heterogeneity of materials and their mechanical behavior, but it is vital to preserve this invaluable cultural heritage by suitable structural assessment techniques. A great deal of research attention has been paid to monitoring their structural health; in many recent publications new advanced technological methods have been provided such as cheaper sensors, wireless connections, non-contact surveys and continuous monitoring. A bibliometric study has shown that more than half of the papers on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Nondestructive Testing (NDT) on masonry have been published between 2018 and 2020, and 30% of those published in 2020 were on ‘slender’ elements like towers, chimneys or minarets. This paper presents a wide-ranging review of static and dynamic studies published on SHM and NDT of slender masonry structures summarizing and discussing the different experimental techniques used. With respect to the dynamic testing, Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) by accelerometers is the mostly frequent used technique by scholars, but other promising methods such as radar interferometry are also reported. This overall discussion is concluded with a short review of some examples on numerical structural health assessment and signal processing tools. An inclusive list of papers is provided describing the most important slender masonry structures characteristics, natural frequencies, experimental and numerical techniques employed and reference values.

Before a damage detection algorithm can be applied, the integrity of the data must be ensured; otherwise results may be misleading or incorrect. Indeed, sensor system malfunction, which results in anomalous data (often called faulty data), is a serious problem, as the sensors usually must operate in extremely harsh environments. Identifying and eliminating anomalies in the data is crucial to ensuring that reliable monitoring results can be achieved. Because of the vast amounts of data typically collected by a structural health monitoring system, manual removal of the anomalous data is prohibitive. Machine learning methods have the potential to automate the process of data anomaly detection. Although supervised methods have been proven to be effective for detecting data anomalies, two unresolved challenges reduce the accuracy of anomaly detection: (1) the class imbalance and (2) incompleteness of anomalous patterns of training dataset. Unsupervised methods have the potential to address these challenges, but improvements are required to deal with vast amounts of monitoring data. In this article, the generative adversarial networks are combined with a widely applied unsupervised method, that is, autoencoders, to improve the performance of existing unsupervised learning methods. In addition, the time-series data are transformed to Gramian Angular Field images so that advanced computer vision methods can be included in the network. Two structural health monitoring datasets from a full-scale bridge, including examples of anomalous data caused by sensor system malfunctions, are utilized to validate the proposed methodology.

The basic goal of using signal processing is to identify the changes or damages from the vibration signals of the dynamic system to detect, locate, and quantify any damages existing in the system. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent progress that used signal processing techniques for vibration based SHM approaches. Furthermore, the feature extraction process through the signal processing techniques is the basic skeleton of this review. The application of signal processing techniques in structural damage identification procedure is classified into two approaches, namely (i) time-domain and (ii) frequency-domain. Experimental studies have assessed the potentials of the signal processing techniques in two aforementioned domains to enhance the vibration-based structural damage detection subjected to environmental effects.

However, most techniques are built upon the assumption that both training and test data were drawn from the same underlying distribution. This fact means that unless test data were obtained from the same system in the same operating conditions, the machine learning inferences from the training data will not provide accurate predictions when applied to the test data. Therefore, to train a robust predictor conventionally, new training data and labels must be recollected for every new structure considered, which is significantly expensive and often impossible in an SHM context. Transfer learning, in the form of domain adaptation, offers a novel solution to these problems by providing a method for mapping feature and label distributions for different structures, labelled source and unlabelled target structures, onto the same space. As a result, classifiers trained on a labelled structure in the source domain will generalise to a different unlabelled target structure. Furthermore, a holistic discussion of contexts in which domain adaptation is applicable are discussed, specifically for population-based SHM. Three domain adaptation techniques are demonstrated on four case studies providing new frameworks for approaching the problem of SHM.","2020-04-01","2024-02-21 14:06:21","2024-02-21 14:06:21","2024-02-21 14:06:21","106550","","","138","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\PDFHWBWG\Gardner et al. - 2020 - On the application of domain adaptation in structu.pdf; C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\DXZEYXR5\S088832701930771X.html","","","Domain adaptation; Population-based SHM; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order for any SHM technology to achieve the technical readiness and performance required for an operational implementation, advanced signal processing algorithms need to be developed to adaptively remove noise and retain the underlying signals of interest that describe the damage-related information. The wavelet packet transform decomposes a measured time domain signal into a time-frequency representation enabling the removal of noise that may overlap with the signal of interest in time and/or frequency. However, the traditional technique suffers from several assumptions limiting its applicability in an operational SHM environment, where the noise conditions commonly exhibit erratic behavior. Furthermore, an exhaustive number of options exist when selecting the parameters used in the technique with limited guidelines that can help select the most appropriate options for a given application. Appropriately defining the technique tends to be a daunting task resulting in a general avoidance of the approach in the field of SHM. This work outlines an adaptive wavelet packet denoising algorithm applicable to numerous SHM technologies including acoustics, vibrations, and acoustic emission. The algorithm incorporates a blend of non-traditional approaches for noise estimation, threshold selection, and threshold application to augment the denoising performance of real-time structural health monitoring measurements. Appropriate wavelet packet parameters are selected through a simulation considering the trade-off between signal to noise ratio improvement and amount of signal energy retained. The wavelet parameter simulation can be easily replicated to accommodate any SHM technology where the underlying signal of interest is known, as is the case in most active-based approaches including acoustic and wave-propagation techniques. The finalized adaptive wavelet packet algorithm is applied to a comprehensive dataset demonstrating an active acoustic damage detection approach on a ~46 m wind turbine blade. The quality of the measured data and the damage detection performance obtained from simple spectral filtering is compared with the proposed wavelet packet technique. It is shown that the damage detection performance is enhanced in all but one test case by as much as 60%, and the false detection rate is reduced. The approach and the subsequent results presented in this paper are expected to help enable advancement in the performance of several established SHM technologies and identifies the considered acoustics-based SHM approach as a noteworthy option for wind turbine blade structural health monitoring.","2020-08-01","2024-02-21 14:06:24","2024-02-21 14:06:24","2024-02-21 14:06:24","106754","","","142","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\LIXGN3IN\S0888327020301400.html","","","Acoustic; Active damage detection; Structural health monitoring; Wavelet packet denoising; Wind turbine blade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beside the complexities derived from multi-modal, dispersive and multi-path characteristics of Lamb waves, one of the main challenges in Lamb wave based SHM is sensitivity of these systems to environmental and operational conditions (EOCs) parameters.

As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learning–based data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.","2019-03-01","2024-02-21 14:07:08","2024-02-21 14:07:08","2024-02-21 14:07:08","401-421","","2","18","","Structural Health Monitoring","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the lamb wave propagation processes in thin structures containing flaws were simulated using the SBFEM, and the echo wave signal at an observation point was recorded and paired with the flaw information. Then, the paired SBFEM datasets were used to train the deep learning model employing a convolutional neural network. A flaw classification and identification model based on SBFEM datasets was established. For a thin structure with unknown flaw information, and by using the measured observation point signals, the established deep learning model can predict flaw information in real time.

However, the conventional vibration–based methods find it difficult to detect damages of actual structures because of a high incompleteness in the monitoring information (the number of sensors is much fewer with respect to the number of degrees of freedom of a structure), intense uncertainties in the structural conditions and monitoring systems, and coupled effects of damage and environmental actions on modal parameters. It is a truth that the performance and conditions of a structure must be embedded in the monitoring data (vehicles, wind, etc.; acceleration, displacement, cable force, strain, images, videos, etc.).

However, information extracted from this type of diagnosis is limited and subjective. Whereas, the vibration-based NDT could provide a comprehensive automatic pile health diagnosis tool. In this paper, a new higher order vibration-based health diagnosis technology, which utilizes a shaker to generate sweep-sine excitation and an adaptive nonlinear non-stationary higher order spectral analysis, is introduced for foundation piles. This research describes two different diagnostic technologies, namely, the advanced nonlinear non-stationary chirp Fourier bicoherence (CFB) technology and the novel nonlinear non-stationary frequency response function of the CFB (FRF-CFB) technology. The CFB is a technology which is capable of quantifying the amplitude and phase coupling between harmonics of pile resonance oscillations caused by a damage. However, in practices, the amplitude and phase coupling between harmonics of pile resonance oscillations may be caused also due to the phase-coupled harmonics of an interference imposed by an excitation source (e.g., shaker). Therefore, the novel diagnosis technology, FRF-CFB, which detects nonlinearity caused solely by a structural damage, is proposed and implemented for real-scale precast concrete piles. It is found that the FRF-CFB technology successfully identifies the damaged piles. Finally, the diagnosis based on the conventional pile integrity testing, conducted on the same piles, is presented for comparisons with the FRF-CFB technology and with the CFB technology.","2020","2024-02-21 14:09:16","2024-02-21 14:09:16","2024-02-21 14:09:16","e2526","","6","27","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/stc.2526","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\UN6JPJ5K\stc.html; C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\SCBV6DZ5\Gelman and Kırlangıç - 2020 - Novel vibration structural health monitoring techn.pdf","","","concrete foundation piles; diagnosis by the higher order spectral analysis; nonlinear vibration; signal processing of non-stationary vibrations; vibration based health diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the structural response to detect the damage in an early stage, evaluate the health condition of structures, and ensure the operation safety of structures. In fact, the structure and the evaluation can be considered as a special symmetry. Among several SHM methods, vibration-based SHM techniques have been widely adopted recently. Hence, this paper reviews the vibration-based SHM methods in terms of the vibrational parameters used. In addition, the technical codes on vibration based SHM system have also been reviewed, since they are more important in engineering applications.

The development and implementation of SHM systems are generally based on wireless sensor networks (WSN) platforms. However, most of the WSN platforms are battery-powered, and therefore, have a limited battery lifetime. The power constraint is generally addressed by applying energy harvesting (EH) technologies. As a result, there exists a plethora of WSN platforms and EH techniques. The employment of a particular platform and technique are important factors during the development and implementation of SHM systems and depend upon various operating conditions. Therefore, there is a need to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) for WSN platforms and EH techniques in the context of SHM for bridges. Although state-of-the-art review articles present multiple angles of the field, there is a lack of an SLR presenting an in-depth comparative study of different WSN platforms and EH techniques. Moreover, a systematic analysis is also needed for the exploration of other design considerations such as inspection scale (global/local), response type (static/dynamic), and types of sensors. As a result, this SLR selects 46 articles (during 2007-2023), related to EH techniques and WSN platforms in SHM for bridges. The selected articles are classified into three groups: WSN platforms, energy harvesting techniques, and a combination of both. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of WSN platforms and EH techniques is made. Furthermore, the selected articles (total = 46) are also explored in terms of sensor type, inspection scale, and response type. As a result, 17 different sensor types are identified. This research is significant as it may facilitate the various stakeholders of the domain during the selection of appropriate WSN platforms, EH techniques, and related design issues.","2023-10-14","2024-02-21 14:13:43","2024-02-21 14:13:43","","8468","","20","23","","Sensors (Basel)","Towards the Structural Health Monitoring of Bridges Using Wireless Sensor Networks","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37896561 PMCID: PMC10611078","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\7NVE4QUR\Sonbul and Rashid - 2023 - Towards the Structural Health Monitoring of Bridge.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37896561","","bridges; energy harvesting; structural health monitoring; systematic literature review; WSN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such local damage usually appears near the boundary of the beam in practices. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the evanescent wave components resulting from the boundary and the crack, leading to confusion in damage identification. In order to tackle this issue, the generalized reflection coefficient of the evanescent wave with respect to the incident propagating wave (GRC-EP) is exploited in the present work, which allows to quantitatively identify the severity of the near-boundary crack. Taking the semi-infinite Timoshenko beam having a crack damage at the fixed end, the generalized reflections of the evanescent and propagating waves at the crack, with respect to a unit incident wave, are derived analytically, showing that the amplitude of the evanescent wave is negatively related to the damage severity. Based on this, the amplitude ratio between the reflected evanescent wave and the incident propagating wave, i.e., the GRC as mentioned, is proposed to be the damage indicator. Referring to the theoretical GRC values, the damage severity can then be identified from the estimated GRCs that are obtained from the inverse algorithm, as long as the acceleration responses are given. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed indicator is verified by taking a slender beam having a local damage at the fixed end as an example. The results show that the proposed GRC-EP is capable to indicate the severity of the near-boundary damage despite the consideration of noise, confirming its potential value in the health monitoring of slender beam structures.","2023-03-17","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","117530","","","547","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bending wave; Damage quantification; Evanescent wave; Generalized reflection coefficient; Near-boundary crack","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a method is developed and theoretical equations are implemented, which provides a guide on the selection of the wave mixing frequency pair. The proposed frequency pair selection method can advance the trial-and-error method that was generally used for low-frequency wave mixing, which has a large number of possible frequency pairs, and deliberate selection is needed to avoid the overlapping of the generated harmonics.

Rather than complex optical hardware setup for phase extraction in commercial digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) or shearography (SG) systems, the proposed numerical (software) DPE implementation via Riesz transform with a log-Gabor filter enables a compact, portable, and cost-effective system for large-area real-time nondestructive inspection (NDI) due to its simplicity, stability, and efficiency. Using speckles in laser speckle interferometry (LSI) speckle pattern is intrinsically noisy; the correlation-based phase signatures derived from Riesz transform followed by the log-Gabor filter is implemented to supplant the conventional phase-difference algorithm to localize damage regions, especially in the case where the high-power diode laser (low coherence) can cause serious phase drift. By enveloping the monogenic signal through Riesz transform for direct phase retrieval is more intuitive than TPS or SPS. This yields visualization of the damage feature with higher fidelity. Consequently, a phase-correlation algorithm becomes a more robust operation to cope with speckle images from the interferometry. This full-field optical SG system was demonstrated and verified in an impacted damaged honeycomb composite panel using the proposed phase-correlation algorithm under thermal stress loading for large-area inspection in near real-time. The visualized damage images enhanced by principal component analysis (PCA) agreed with images from pulse laser/LDV and X-ray CT scan. The DPE algorithm has a promising potential to apply on any optical metrology for instantaneous phase estimation and can combine with selected imaging conditions for multi-damage detection.","2022-12-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","102711","","","132","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Barely visible impact damage (BVID); Direct phase estimation (DPE); Log-gabor bandpass (bp) filter; Riesz transform; Shearography (SG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imaging performance of minimum variance is highly dependent on the design accuracy of look-direction to describe amplitude relationship of array reflection signals. Look-direction is the combination of a directivity reflection pattern and an attenuation with propagation distance. However, reflection pattern is closely related to damage parameters (e.g. type, orientation and size) and these parameters are usually unknown beforehand. Therefore, accurate design of look-direction is difficult or even impossible, and design error can significantly degrade imaging performance. To overcome this limitation, a modified minimum variance method is proposed in this study. Besides amplitude information, waveform information is integrated into algorithm imaging procedure. Correlation coefficient between local signal and excitation waveform is calculated to generate the distribution of weights for diagonal loading. Diagonal loading weight is an adjustable coefficient in minimum variance algorithm to control the tolerance for look-direction error. With larger weights for potential damage locations, tolerance for inaccuracy in look-direction is increased, and imaging performance is accordingly improved.

Condition monitoring is a necessity to ensure that the structures are being safely used and to extend their lifetime. Lamb waves (LWs) are ultrasonic guided waves that are widely used for structural health monitoring of mechanical, aerospace, and civil structures. This paper proposes a novel structural health monitoring approach for damage detection, localization, and assessment using a minimal LW sensor-actuator set-up. More specifically, the proposed framework provides damage detection, localization and assessment within a dissimilar-material joint by Bayesian inference of six parameters of damage extent and location. Finite element simulations are used to simulate the measured LWs and generate a dataset required to train artificial neural networks (ANN), acting as surrogate models for LW simulation with reduced computational cost. The ANN-based LW simulations are further used as forward model within an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework to provide probabilistic inference of the damage size and position. The results show that damage of different sizes and locations can be successfully identified with a high level of resolution and with quantified uncertainty. The results also show that data fusion for ABC inference using multiple sensor measurements can be possible with improved inference results. However, a precise and robust damage inference can be achieved using a minimal sensing set-up based on one actuator and two sensing points, with consideration of certain levels of measurement noise. These findings imply a considerable reduction of complexity of LW actuator-sensor networks, and overall, they imply a significant reduction of computational resources and cost for damage detection and assessment in structures, thus providing a step forward towards online/onboard monitoring applications.","2022-06-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","102626","","","128","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural network; Bayesian inverse problem; Dissimilar joints; Lamb waves; Structural health monitoring; Surrogate modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to address the requirement for efficient and accurate stress measurement of large component composite plates by proposing an air-coupled ultrasonic in-situ measurement method. Ultrasonic Lamb waves can propagate over long distances while maintaining sensitivity to slight changes and are suitable for in-situ stress measurement of CFRP plates. However, due to the serious mismatch in acoustic impedance, the air-coupled ultrasonic Lamb waves have a low signal-to-noise ratio, which can affect the accuracy of stress measurement. Focusing on this problem, the method employs the Lyapunov exponent with a moving window to accurately extract the acoustic-time characteristic instead of just judging the presence or absence of a weak signal compared with the traditional method of using the Lyapunov exponent. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in different fiber directions of CFRP plates, seven uniaxial tensile specimens are obtained along 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90° fiber directions, respectively. Utilize stress coefficient calibration results KL to realize the uniaxial stress measurement with a spatial resolution of 150 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that the stress measurement errors are within ±7.29 MPa in the range of 0–150 MPa, and the standard deviations of the repeatability measurement experiment are below 4.57 MPa.

Multimode response involving two fundamental modes, i.e., flexural and axial, and two higher-order wave-modes, i.e., shear and thickness contraction have been considered in the present work. The model is based on higher order beam theory which uses wave kinematics to extract individual wave modes from the multimode response. Further, a numerical finite element model is employed to validate the deformation profile of this analytical model. The embedment of thin film sensors at the same location but within different layers produce signals that exhibit a relative difference in the phase and amplitude due to kinematics. The sensor signals are then post-processed to obtain individual Lamb wave modes. Experiments are carried out to validate the procedure for extracting individual guided wave mode response. The method is independent of sampling rate and works in the presence of complicated mode converted responses.

Therefore, numerous types of nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring techniques have been developed for damage identification in composite structures, among which ultrasonic guided waves, particularly Lamb waves, have gained much popularity. In recent years, apart from piezoelectric pointwise measurements, laser Doppler vibrometry has been used for full wavefield measurements of propagating Lamb waves. Damage imaging can be done with animations of Lamb waves interacting with defects. In this work, two end-to-end deep learning-based models of many-to-one sequence prediction were developed to perform pixel-wise image segmentation. A large dataset of full wavefield images resulting from the interaction with delamination of random size, shape, and location was utilised to train the proposed deep learning models. The main goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of implementing deep learning methods for delamination identification in composite laminates by only utilising the animations of Lamb waves. The elaborated models worked well on the numerically generated test data and have also shown good performance on the real-world experimental data. These methods can enable the automation of delamination identification and to create damage maps without the intervention of the user.","2023-01-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","105520","","","117","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Autoencoder; ConvLSTM; Deep learning; Delamination identification; Lamb waves; Semantic segmentation; Structural health monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using rails as a case study for simulation and validation of the excitation effect, array comb sensors are arranged along the rail web. By adjusting the time delay and phase compensation of the comb excitation sensors, the single excitation of the rail head, rail web, and rail base detection modes is achieved over a wide frequency range.

Finite element simulations are used to investigate the influence of sensor spacing and number of sensor points on the array comb excitation effect, and suggestions are made for optimising the array comb excitation.

Throughout the years, various designs were developed and found their applications. Currently, there are five designs, which can be subdivided into two main categories - with a load-sharing metal liner and with a non-load-sharing plastic liner. The main damage mechanism defining the lifetime of the first type is fatigue of the metal liner, whereas for the second type it is fatigue of the composite overwrap. Nevertheless, one damage type which may drastically reduce the lifetime of COPV is impact-induced damage. Therefore, this barely visible damage needs to be assessed in a non-destructive way to decide whether the pressure vessel can be further used or has to be put out of service. One of the possible methods is based on ultrasonic waves. In this contribution, both conventional ultrasonic testing (UT) by high-frequency bulk waves and wavenumber mapping by low frequency guided waves are used to evaluate impact damage. Wavenumber mapping techniques are first benchmarked on a simulated aluminium panel then applied to experimental measurements acquired on a delaminated aluminium-CFRP composite plate which corresponds to a structure of COPV with a load-sharing metal liner. The analysis of experimental data obtained from measurements of guided waves propagating in an aluminium-CFRP composite plate with impact-induced damage is performed. All approaches show similar performance in terms of quantification of damage size and depths while being applied to numerical data. The approaches used on the experimental data deliver an accurate estimate of the in-plane size of the large delamination at the aluminium-CFRP interface but only a rough estimate of its depth. Moreover, none of the wavenumber mapping techniques used in the study can quantify every delamination between CFRP plies caused by the impact, which is the case for conventional UT. This may be solved by using higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) or more advanced signal processing techniques. All in all, it can be concluded that imaging of complex impact damage in fibre-reinforced composites based on wavenumber mapping is not straightforward and stays a challenging task.","2021-09-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","102472","","","122","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Instantaneous wavenumber analysis; Local wavenumber analysis; Signal processing; Ultrasonic guided waves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To avoid unnecessary complexity, only longitudinal GW modes for bare and embedded rebar are excited and received to detect and locate debonding.

To develop MICCP as ready product for field scale construction, mineral based inoculum of higher shelf life is required. The present study focuses on this aspect of field based application of MICCP. In this study, mineral admixture (silica fume (SF), cement kiln dust (CKD) and rice husk ash (RHA)) based bacterial inoculum were developed to immobilize bacteria for self healing capabilities in concrete. The prepared inoculum was stored at varying temperature (4 °C and 25 °C) and the survival of bacterial cells in carrier based materials were tested on weekly basis until 180 days of storage at both temperature. After 180 days of storage, the most efficient bacterial inoculum based upon viability studies was incorporated in concrete and tested for crack healing performance. For this, crack of approximately 0.5 mm width was generated during the casting and healed using a bacteria-based healing agent (nutrient broth, urea and CaCl2). The healed cracked surface was examined through optical imaging to monitor the crack width reduction. Along with this, Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) technique was used to monitor the crack healing potential until the full healing of cracked surface was achieved. Statistical EMI indicators such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD) and correlation coefficient deviation (CCD) were employed to quantify crack healing process. RMSD was found to be promising parameter to monitor the crack healing process and reflected an increasing trend from 1 % to 14 % in healed bacterial specimen. At the end of test, the healed specimens were subjected to bending failure to assess the strength regain. Significant regain was noticed in healed bacterial specimen (approximately 33 %) in comparison to the control. The healing mineral precipitated inside the cracks was examined through field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to evaluate its physicochemical attributes. The results give clear proof that the SF-based carrier material can be effectively used in healing the cracks and the crack healing process can be efficiently monitored by the EMI technique. Results further indicated that RMSD values were very effective in quantifying the progressive crack healing achieved due to MICCP precipitation.","2022-09-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","1342-1355","","","43","","Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cell viability; Concrete; Crack width; Electromechanical Impedance EMI); MICCP; Silica Fume (SF)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data-driven approaches have great potential in damage detection for CFRP composites. However, the lack of physical interpretability makes data-driven methods highly dependent on the amount of data, which involves significant effort in experiment and is impractical to obtain for all damage conditions. To overcome the above challenges, a robust and generalizable framework for damage detection of CFRP composite structures is proposed by fusing monitoring data with physical mechanisms. In this framework, the numerical method is leveraged to build physical models of the composite structures to generate data under various damage conditions. Then, a deep transfer learning-based model is applied in the fusion of experiment and simulation data, which mitigates the discrepancy between the physical model and real experiment. With the combination of domain adaptation and domain adversarial training in the model, the domain invariant features can be generalized from the source domain (simulation data) to the target domain (experiment data). Therefore, the physical interpretability is supplemented in the data-driven model. To verify the adaptability of the method, different transfer tasks based on the accelerated aging experiments are performed. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the dependence of the data-driven methods on real monitoring data and prevails in all evaluation indicators than other methods.

In use, it is subject to weathering degradation. This causes surface changes that reduce its optical properties. After carrying out a spectral characterization of their effects, we highlight that the changes produced have a specific signature in the LWIR band due to the IR absorbing properties of the glass. Therefore, LWIR cameras used as radiometers are perfectly suited for their quantification by a non-contact measurement of their LWIR apparent emissivity. The LWIR apparent emissivity is provided in a quantitative thermographic approach. Based on the imaging capabilities of the thermal camera, it is possible to generate a 2D mapping of the surface changes in the form of an emissogram. The metrological capabilities of LWIR bolometric thermal cameras are then tested under laboratory conditions (strict control of influence temperatures) and under outdoor conditions. Under laboratory conditions, LWIR apparent emissivity is capable of quantifying specral anomalies as small as A=5%μm. The indicator is suitable for managing the effects of erosion and hydration of glass, respectively from 8 % of the eroded surface and from 100h of humid heat (2 years of natural exposure in a temperate climate). In outdoor conditions, the reflected temperature is an advantage because it improves the Type B accuracy of LWIR apparent emissivity measurements. Assuming a 3 °C non-uniformity of surface temperature, as it is the case for PV systems with active cooling, we conclude that erosion effects should be quantifiable from 48 % of the eroded surface, allowing optical transmittance losses of glass to be detected from 10 %. The effects of glass hydration remain difficult to manage due to the weakness of the spectral anomalies they produce.","2024-03-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","102998","","","142","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Erosion of soda-lime glass; FLIR A325sc metrological characteristics; FLIR E300 metrological characteristics; Hydration of soda lime glass; LWIR apparent emissivity; Non-destructive testing tool; Type B uncertainty of LWIR apparent emissivity measurements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pre-dispersive wideband excitations of a certain Lamb wave mode are generated based on the configuration of transducers, and reconstruction independent component analysis is used for wave mode separation. According to the acoustic reciprocity principle, self-compensation phenomenon of mode signals can be recorded on the intact path, where the signal energy concentrates at a fix self-compensation point in the time–frequency domain, yet such compensation effect would be impaired encountering defects. Thus, a time–frequency index can be used as the DI, which is calculated based on the weighted Euclidean distance from the self-compensation point to the pixel points in the time–frequency domain.

However, for GWs to be applied reliably in service, the effect of temperature needs to be accounted for baseline damage detection approaches. Previous studies have focused on developing temperature compensation methods for surface-mounted transducers. In this paper, an extensive investigation has been carried out to develop an effective temperature compensation method for GWs generated by embedded transducers in different thickness composites. To accomplish this, Laser Doppler Vibrometer experiments were carried out to obtain wavenumbers generated by embedded transducers and to compare them against surface mounted cases. The consistent trend observation of dispersion curves between surface-mounted and embedded PZTs serves as a foundation for conducting analysis of the embedded signals with the effect of temperature. Following that, GW propagation has been studied in three quasi-isotropic composites of 2 mm, 4 mm and 9 mm thicknesses. Based on the established temperature database with measurements from − 50 °C to 70 °C, a temperature compensation methodology has been developed and validated with the temperature difference of 30 °C. It demonstrates that the temperature effect on the embedded PZTs is lower in comparison to surface mounted PZTs, and the temperature compensation of a single thickness composite is scalable to other panels thickness. This novel methodology proves beneficial in reducing the scale of the experimental campaign required, which holds significant value for actual aeronautical structures characterized by variable composite thicknesses across different sections, such as in fuselage panels or wing boxes.","2024-01-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","102988","","","141","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Embedded PZTs; Laser Doppler vibrometer; Structural health monitoring; Temperature compensation; Ultrasonics guided wave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of many nondestructive testing techniques, laser ultrasonic testing is a non-contact method that yields accurate inspection results with high spatial resolution; this method was adopted in this study for the inspection of thick composite structures. We propose a novel guided-wave ultrasonic propagation imaging (UPI) method, called the reverberation wave UPI (R-wave UPI), which is capable of faster target scanning and clearer highlighting of confining waves. To prove the merits of the R-wave UPI, a relatively thin carbon/epoxy composite (thickness, 12 mm) was first tested using the proposed method and the conventional through-transmission UPI. The R-wave UPI modifies the guided-wave UPI with a faster pulse repetition frequency (PRF) laser and ultrasonic energy mapping with straightforward parameter determination. The through-transmission UPI consisting of a raster mechanical scanner, a Q-switched laser, and a laser Doppler vibrometer, was used as a reference, whereas the R-wave UPI consisting of an angular laser mirror scanner, a Q-switched laser, and a PZT sensor was operated at a high PRF in the kilohertz regime to induce reverberation. The reverberation phenomenon was used in the post-image processing, called ultrasonic energy mapping (UEM). UEM with a high PRF was then compared to the through-transmission inspection reference to verify its accuracy and reliability for mapping of structural anomalies. Finally, a thick and curved composite blade with a rough and curved surface that could not be inspected using the conventional through-transmission UPI was tested using 7 kHz PRF and its delamination was successfully visualized using the UEM.","2021-03-01","2024-02-21 14:20:15","2024-02-21 14:20:15","","113446","","","259","","Composite Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Guided-wave inspection; Laser ultrasonic testing; Reverberation; Thick composite structures; Ultrasonic propagation imager","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mechanical behaviour of tension cables is complex as it is dominated by geometric nonlinearities, complex support conditions and uncertainties arising from the composition of the cable cross section. Numerous models to describe static and dynamic cable behaviour were developed, differing in the model assumptions and the simplifications made. Most common are geometrical linearisation, dimensional reduction, and the disregard of localised support and stiffness effects. Some models take a combination of some geometric nonlinearities, cable bending stiffness and certain boundary effects into account. This paper first presents a literature review aimed at systematically categorising cable force identification models. Based on this, the paper proposes a novel numerical cable modelling framework that allows for accurate predictions of static and dynamic cable response, e.g. for the use in the inverse system identification techniques of Structural Health Monitoring. The saddled cable model is based on a nonlinear Finite Element formulation to account for the geometric and mechanical effects of deviating supports on structural cables even for very large sag cables. After validation with analytical solutions, the models show that the effect of self-weight distribution and cable bending stiffness considerably affects the identified internal force distribution, contact length on the saddle and cable form. Further, the model is used to predict the tension force based on the identified natural frequencies of an external tendon installed on a bridge.

The strong variations create challenges for pure analytical solutions in infrared image segmentation of delaminated areas. The recently developed supervised deep learning approach demonstrated the potentials in achieving automatic segmentation of RGB images. However, its effectiveness in segmenting thermal images remains under-explored. The main challenge lies in the development of specific models and the generation of a large range of labeled infrared images for training. To address this challenge, a customized deep learning model based on encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to segment the delaminated areas in thermal images at the pixel level. Data augmentation strategies were implemented in creating the training data set to improve the performance of the proposed model. The deep learning generated model was deployed in a real-world project to further evaluate the model's applicability and robustness. The results of these experimental studies supported the effectiveness of the deep learning model in segmenting concrete delamination areas from infrared images. It also suggested that data augmentation is a helpful technique to address the small size issue of training samples. The field test with validation further demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed framework.

In this study, a novelty method for structural damage identification is developed, which employs an advanced surrogate modelling technique to drive a new hybrid optimization strategy, namely a combination of K-means clustering optimizer and genetic algorithm (HKOGA). The core of this method is using the reliable sparse polynomial chaos expansion model as a cost-effective substitute for the computationally expensive structural finite element models, thus greatly improving the efficiency of the optimization strategy in finding the optimal value of the objective function. To evaluate the performance of this hybrid optimization strategy, seven optimization algorithms are selected and compared with it for 23 classical benchmark functions, and the comparative results show that the HKOGA has the best performance. Taking a small-scaled laboratory dam as an example, the efficiency and reliability of the proposed method to cope with the problems concerning finite element model updating and structural damage identification are explored. Two important findings are as follows. (i) For finite element model updating, compared to the conventional method based on iterative optimization, the proposed method improves computational efficiency by a factor of 59 while maintaining computational accuracy. (ii) For structural damage identification, leaving aside the huge leap in computational efficiency, the HKOGA has a faster convergence rate, stronger robustness, and higher accuracy than its sub-algorithm K-means clustering optimizer (KO).

Recently, many approaches based on ultrasonic guided waves have been developed. However, during the propagation of guided waves, as the propagation distance increases, the signal amplitude attenuates gradually, as a result, the reflected wave packets from the incipient defects are always seriously contaminated or even buried in noise, and the defect signatures cannot be effectively identified in this circumstance. To detect incipient defect as early as possible to ensure structure safety, it is very essential to suppress the background noise and enhance the reflected wave packet from defect. To address this issue, a physics-informed deep filtering method is proposed for ultrasonic guided waves enhancement. In the proposed method, a deep learning model is constructed and trained based on template signals of ultrasonic guided waves simulated by digital model with different parameters, and then generalized to enhancement of weak ultrasonic guided waves from practical cases.

The scattering behaviour is represented by first-order approximations of the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated with a perturbation approach, both at the fundamental frequency and at the generated third harmonic. Due to its nonlinearity and spatial asymmetry, such a system behaves in general nonreciprocally. By analyzing the fundamental-frequency and third-harmonic transmission coefficients, we derive conditions for particular scattering behaviours that result in transmission symmetry for the nonlinear system. We show that a sufficient condition for symmetric fundamental-frequency transmission is that the spacing between the scatterers is a multiple of half the incident wavelength, regardless of the scatterers’ properties, although the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients will still depend on the incident-wave amplitude. Such a response is also possible if the real and imaginary parts of the admittance of the linear scatterer satisfy a certain mathematical relation, regardless of spacing. A particular choice of lossless linear scatterer combined with the separation distance being a multiple of half a wavelength leads to fully linear behaviour for the nonlinear multiple scattering system.","2022-12-22","2024-02-21 14:20:16","2024-02-21 14:20:16","","117310","","","541","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Flexural beam; Linear behaviour; Multiple scattering; Nonlinear scatterer; Symmetric transmission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many of the available methods rely on using the conventional features of AE signals for clustering. These clusters are then related to a specific failure mechanism based on their behaviors. The conventional AE features are derived from a portion of the signal waveform that passes through a pre-determined threshold and is heavily affected by attenuation. Therefore, recent studies on AE are more focused on waveform analysis. A key parameter when analyzing the waveform distribution is the selection of appropriate bin width. This study discusses the choice of an optimum bin width for waveform analysis. This parameter is then shown to be well correlated to the conventional threshold-dependent features of AE signals. The bin width is then used as a time-domain representation of the waveform and is used with the peak frequency for signal clustering. A series of tensile tests are performed on cross-ply and quasi-isotropic open-hole carbon FRP (CFRP) specimens. The results show that AE signal clustering using these features outperform clustering performance using conventional AE features.

A wide range of manufacturing processes are used in composites production and each of these processes is marked by many processing parameters. However, because of the variations that are inherent to the manufacturing method, the final properties of the structure can be strongly affected, mainly the strength values. On the other hand, Vibration-Based Methods (VBM) has the advantage of simplicity and low cost, although it is very sensitive to variations in geometry and material properties. Therefore, it is strategic to deepen the research in this line to generalize the method, allowing its use in the industry as a solution to complicated real-life problems. Thus, this work presents a new numerical-experimental methodology to evaluate the effect of design parameter variations on the dynamic response of laminated composite cylinders. Numerical dynamic analyses are run via a Finite Element code, which is complemented with subroutines written in Python. A Design of Experiments (DoE) strategy is developed to reduce the number of experiments and to evaluate the effect of the design parameter variations. Three sets of nominally different composite cylinders are investigated [(90/60/-60)2/90]s, [(90/30/-30)2/90]s and [90/30/-60/60/-60/30/-30]s. System natural frequencies as taken as the primary response quantities. Frequency Response Functions (FRF) enrich the data set for more elaborate analysis. A DoE strategy is set up to deal with the range of design parameters and process parameters, a full factorial design is selected. Afterward, the results are discussed with proper attention for the potential and limitations of the proposed methodology from the perspective of usage to detect defects in real laminated composite cylinders. Finally, damage indices are calculated using the experimental FRFs magnitudes to quantify the influence of the undamaged and impact damage structure. The general conclusion is that the new methodology provides the foundations for the next generation of software systems for detecting defects from the manufacturing process and damage caused in-service of real composite structures.","2021-11-15","2024-02-21 14:20:16","2024-02-21 14:20:16","","114548","","","276","","Composite Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Composite cylinders; Damage detection; Filament Winding; Finite Element Analysis; Low-frequency dynamics; Manufacturing defects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two parameters, AE hit rate and absolute AE energy, are used to characterize the stiffness degradation behavior of CFRP structures. The strain field distribution characteristics during the damage failure of specimens with different stacking sequences are discussed in association with DIC.

The relationship between residual fatigue life and natural frequencies is examined through modal testing and fatigue measurements on FRP beam specimens. Two prediction methods; semi-empirical models and machine learning (ML) algorithms, are utilized. The semi-empirical models are derived from existing “residual stiffness” models based on the relationship between bending stiffness and flexural frequencies. ML algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are developed for fatigue life prediction. Experimental validation is performed using measured frequencies during fatigue testing of FRP beams. The ML algorithms can use multimode frequencies unlike single mode of semi-empirical models. The verification results show that the ML algorithms can be used to predict the residual fatigue life with the selection of the appropriate mode of frequency.

An appropriate HI should conform to prognostic criteria, i.e., monotonicity, trendability, and prognosability, that are commonly utilized to measure the HI’s quality. However, constructing such a HI is challenging, particularly for composite structures due to their vulnerability to complex damage scenarios. Data-driven models and deep learning are powerful mathematical tools that can be employed to achieve this purpose. Yet the availability of a large dataset with labels plays a crucial role in these fields, and the data collected by SHM methods can only be labeled after the structure fails. In this respect, semi-supervised learning can incorporate unlabeled data monitored from structures that have not yet failed. In the present work, a semi-supervised deep neural network is proposed to construct HI by SHM data fusion. For the first time, the prognostic criteria are used as targets of the network rather than employing them only as a measurement tool of HI’s quality. In this regard, the acoustic emission method was used to monitor composite panels during fatigue loading, and extracted features were used to construct an intelligent HI. Finally, the proposed roadmap is evaluated by the holdout method, which shows a 77.3% improvement in the HI’s quality, and the leave-one-out cross-validation method, which indicates the generalized model has at least an 81.77% score on the prognostic criteria. This study demonstrates that even when the true HI labels are unknown but the qualified HI pattern (according to the prognostic criteria) can be recognized, a model can still be built that provides HIs aligning with the desired degradation behavior.","2023-01-01","2024-02-21 14:20:28","2024-02-21 14:20:28","","105502","","","117","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Composite structures; Intelligent health indicator; Prognostic and health management; Semi-supervised deep neural network; Structural health monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The principles for super resolution imaging technique and defect characterization based on ultrasonic image have been presented firstly. And then both TR-MUSIC and PC-MUSIC are tested with experimental ultrasonic array data acquired from the metallic samples including defects using the full matrix capture (FMC) process. Here, if the size of defect is smaller than the central ultrasonic wavelength, the defect can be regarded as point-like target. On the contrary, if the size of defect is larger than the central ultrasonic wavelength, it can be regarded as extended target. The comparison on super resolution imaging for point-like and extended targets has been investigated. For point-like targets, TR-MUSIC as well as PC-MUSIC can distinguish and locate the position, and the overall performance of TR-MUSIC is better than that of PC-MUSIC.

This is all the more difficult since composite materials are concerned and since the finite size of the piece cannot be ignored. A simulation tool for choosing the most appropriate transducer in a given application, for optimally positioning transducers by considering the actual testing configuration etc., would be most valuable to practitioners.

This algorithm optimizes the probability distribution near the damage boundary to enhance the accuracy of damage imaging. The skewed bilateral boundary distribution algorithm can improve the probability distribution of edges on both sides of the damage and alleviate the problem of abnormal boundary expansion.

Subsequently, based on the interaction between guided wave features and damage, a feature extraction-ML based anti-interference damage localization scheme was proposed. This scheme achieved robust damage localization through steps such as data cleaning, feature extraction, feature selection, and ML-based damage localization. Furthermore, this study introduced the guided wave-temporal convolutional network (GW-TCN) model based on deep learning method. The GW-TCN model integrates the temporal correlation and the multi-channel physical properties of guided waves, while leveraging the advantages of deep learning's adaptive feature extraction. It effectively mitigates the vibration and sensor failure interferences that mimic real operational conditions, enabling precise damage localization. Finally, through validation on multiple data samples, it was demonstrated that the model exhibits good generalization ability.

This SHM-ML synergy has gained popularity in the last years thanks to the anticipation of maintenance provided by arising ML algorithms and their ability of handling large quantities of data and considering their influence in the problem. In this paper we develop a novel ML nearest-neighbors-alike algorithm based on the principle of maximum entropy to predict fatigue damage (Palmgren–Miner index) in composite materials by processing the signals of Lamb Waves – a non-destructive SHM technique – with other meaningful features such as layup parameters and stiffness matrices calculated from the Classical Laminate Theory (CLT). The full data analysis cycle is applied to a dataset of delamination experiments in composites. The predictions achieve a good level of accuracy, similar to other ML algorithms, e.g. Neural Networks or Gradient-Boosted Trees, and computation times are of the same order of magnitude. The key advantages of our proposal are: (1) The automatic determination of all the parameters involved in the prediction, so no hyperparameters have to be set beforehand, which saves time devoted to hypertuning the model and also represents an advantage for autonomous, self-supervised SHM. (2) No training is required, which, in an online learning context where streams of data are fed continuously to the model, avoids repeated training—essential for reliable real-time, continuous monitoring.","2023-05-15","2024-02-21 14:20:28","2024-02-21 14:20:28","","115829","","","283","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data-driven analysis; Machine learning; Maximum entropy; Structural Health Monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a novel metasurface is proposed to simultaneously manipulate multi-mode guided waves in plate, including shear horizontal wave, symmetric mode and anti-symmetric mode Lamb waves. For controlling the guided wave propagation in plate, the functional unit is designed by a staggered arrangement of in-plane polarized and out-of-plane polarized piezoelectric patches attached on both surfaces of host plate to form a metasurface, and each piezoelectric patch is individually connected with negative capacitance circuit. The transmitted phase of each mode guided wave through the functional unit can be shifted arbitrarily in 0∼2π range by adjusting the shunting negative capacitance circuits. Furthermore, the transmitted phase shifts profile along the metasurface can be coded to control the wave front of multi-mode guided waves in plate, and tunable functions including anomalous refraction and wave focusing can be realized. Results indicate that the proposed metasurface can simultaneously modulate and control the wave front of each mode guided wave to achieve wave mode splitting and purifying from multi-mode incident waves. In addition, a wave source shifter is realized by an annularly arranged metasurface to achieve equivalent wave source control.

Towards this, a series of GW propagation-based laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out on the SCS sample. The debonding regions of variable size and locations were assessed using a pre-defined network of piezoelectric lead zirconate transducers (PZT). Besides, several artificial masses were also placed in the SCS to validate the multi-step structural health monitoring (SHM) strategy. The SHM approach uses a proposed quick damage identification matrix maps and an improved elliptical wave processing (EWP) strategy of the registered GW signals to detect the locations of debonding and other damages in the SCS. The benefit of the proposed damage identification map is to locate the damaged area (sectors) quickly. This identification step is followed by applying the damage localization step using the improved EWP only on the previously identified damage sector region. The proposed EWP has shown the potential to effectively locate the hidden multiple debonding regions and damages in the SCS with a reduced number of calculations using a step-wise approach that uses only a selected number of grid points. The paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on data gathered from numerical simulations and experimental studies. Thus, using the above-mentioned SHM strategy debondings and damages present within and outside the sensor network are localized.

The method's concept is to directly induce rebars' vibrations (not a whole structure), measure them, and analyze the frequency spectrum changes. Past studies have already proved that vibrational characteristics are susceptible to a structure debonding. The novelty of the method is related to excitation and detection of vibrations in the tested elements. The M5 method is presented against the background of other nondestructive methods used currently in building diagnostics. The comparison contains the classification and review of these methods. Two versions of the excitation subsystems were proposed and tested. In both cases, the excited vibrations, which are the reaction of reinforcing bars to an alternating magnetic field, are measured using a magnetically coupled accelerometer.

The monitoring can be performed by distributed strain measurements using strain gauges or fiber optical sensors. In this work, an advanced local residual classifier for strain-based damage detection and localization is introduced. The key principle is that a change in the relationship between a strain sensor and its neighbors indicates the presence of damage. After defining a sensor grid with sensor locations and their orientation, the relationship can be obtained from numerical simulations of the healthy structure. Here, local regression models are estimated between each master sensor and its neighboring sensors. Then, residuals of the predicted and measured strains are evaluated using a random forest classifier. The evaluation of the residuals has the advantage that the method is independent of the load level, as well as the fact that it is independent of certain environmental influences that are uniformly distributed over the entire structure. In addition to the numerical healthy strains, synthetically generated damage data are used for training the classifier. The synthetic data are obtained by statistical modifications of the healthy strains. This procedure avoids time-consuming and expensive damage simulations. The health monitoring approach is applied to a glass fiber reinforced polymer sandwich structure, imitating an aircraft spoiler, with a hole in the face layer considered as damage. The validation is performed by numerical finite element simulations as well as physical experiments under random loading conditions.

Despite the constant development of novel damage detection algorithms employing guided waves, the phenomenon of wave propagation still needs detailed recognizing and understanding for the further progress of non-destructive wave-based methods. Special attention is paid to guided waves in plate-like structures, but the majority of considered cases concern plates with constant thickness. However, in the real world, we often deal with specimens with variable thickness. The thickness variability of the specimen is often forced to fulfill the construction requirements and optimize stress distribution or is the result of degradation i.e. corrosion. Thus, the development of NDT methods forces the need of considering specimens with complex geometry and the problem of wave propagation in waveguides with variable thickness is crucial for improving novel as well as so far proposed algorithms. The article presents the results of the analytical, numerical and experimental analysis of wave propagation in plates with variable thickness.

In this paper, we compare the propagation characteristics of both Lamb modes and SH0 mode in variable thickness plates and propose to use the SH0 mode for defect identification in such waveguides because of its non-dispersive property. First, the non-dispersive property of the SH0 mode in waveguides with variable thickness is demonstrated in theory. Then, a wave prediction method is adopted to illustrate the differences between the Lamb modes and the SH0 mode when propagating in waveguides with constant or variable thickness. Finally, experiments are conducted on a variable thickness plate to verify the non-dispersive property of the SH0 mode and further compare the results with those of the Lamb modes. Recently developed thickness-poled omnidirectional shear horizontal piezoelectric transducers (OSH-PTs) are used to produce pure SH0 waves. It is observed that the velocity of the Lamb modes may change significantly and the group velocity of the S0 mode even decreases by 55.1% during propagation, which hampers Lamb modes from defect identification in variable thickness plates. By contrast, the SH0 mode is non-dispersive thus promising for damage detection, and its effectiveness for defect localization in such structures is validated experimentally.","2023-09-01","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","102886","","","138","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adiabatic modes; Defect identification; Shear horizontal wave; Variable thickness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques, such as the Electromechanical Impedance Spectroscopy (EMIS), aims to outpace NDT by continuously monitoring structures for defects. However, given the complexity of adhesive joint structures, EMIS capability for damage detection still needs to be thoroughly studied. In this manner, electrical impedance measurements were done to Single Lap Joints (SLJ), with both a modified epoxy adhesive and Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) for void detection. Void defects could not be detected on adhesive joints with the PSA but, in the case of joints with the modified epoxy adhesive, impedance signatures were significantly altered by the presence of both the artificially created void, and by a second damage source caused during the SLJ manufacture.

It emerges from the confluence of operational technologies (OT) and information technologies (IT), which allows for higher flexibility and manufacturing of unique custom products to suit individual customer requirements. To assure quality, embracing digital transformation of non-destructive evaluation is essential. It can be an integral part of the cyber-controlled production and asset life-cycle maintenance. These two value propositions covering the asset life cycle, require digitally controlled NDE procedures and qualitative data to support automated decision making, for most known situations. With that scenario, NDE must be considered in conjunction with other engineering disciplines. Reliability assessments become a necessary prerequisite for the use of NDE data. In addition, the approach to inspector certification and experience needs to be revised. The digital technologies that are being deployed to enhance production under industry 4.0 can very well be the enablers of digitalized NDE and their integration with the asset and its owner. Model-based definition, smart robots, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and digital twins can all be used to enhance NDE inspections to a new level of performance in quality and safety assurance. These new NDE trends are summarized under the term “NDE 4.0” to meet the needs of Industry 4.0. The present review paper is aimed at capturing recent advances in digital technologies for non-destructive inspections, examples of their use, and other aspects that must be addressed to shift the paradigm. The paper also highlights the global collaboration and current trends, with an intent to inspire industry professionals to engage with NDE 4.0 – a must for Industry 4.0.","2023-12-01","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","102957","","","140","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This technique is especially well-suited for the condition-based conservation of historical structures, where minimal invasiveness must be ensured owing to their high cultural and architectural value. Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) techniques represent a valuable tool for efficiently designing the sensor layout in a SHM system in order to achieve an effective modal identification with a reduced number of sensors and, consequently, an improved cost efficiency. In this light, this paper proposes a design methodology of sensor networks based on OSP techniques suitable for historical structures. To do so, a preliminary extensive OMA campaign is conducted in order to construct a reliable finite element (FE) model by fitting the identified modal properties. Afterwards, an optimal sensor arrangement with a limited number of sensors is obtained by applying different model-based OSP techniques. In order to improve the robustness of the solution, material uncertainties are included in the model and the optimal sensor placement is conducted within a statistical framework. This methodology is presented and evaluated with a case study of a Spanish secular building: the Monastery of San Jerónimo de Buenavista in Seville (Spain). In particular, this paper presents the results of the preliminary ambient vibration test and the modal identification of the monastery, the updating process of the FE model, as well as a critical review of the different OSP techniques within a framework of material parameter uncertainty. The presented analysis demonstrate that OSP techniques based on the rank optimization of the kinetic energy matrix of the structure yield robust sensor layout.","2020-01-01","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","109843","","","202","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ambient vibration test; Historical building; Non-destructive test; Operational modal analysis; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multi-aperture (MA) beamforming has previously been shown to increase frame rates, and hence inspection speed, when compared to traditional linear beamforming, in both NDT as well as medical applications. In this work an adaptive MA and spacing concept is presented to autonomously optimise the MA focal laws for the sample in question as well as a critical defect size. For this, full-matrix capture (FMC) data from a calibration sample, designed specifically for the target defect size and spacing, is used to drive the resultant optimised inspection scenario. A 6.7-fold increase in scanning speed with no degradation in resolution or defect sizing accuracy is reported. Three inspection scenarios are presented using firstly linear beamforming at 3.0 mms−1 and 22.0 mms−1 and finally MA beamforming at 22.0 mms−1. Resolutions of 0.8, 5.4 and 0.8 mm in the scan axis are recorded and consequently the optimum scenario, allowing for high resolution at the higher scanning speed, is presented.

The proposed approach adopts an iterative optimization procedure based on sequential backward selection, and is termed receiver optimized total focusing method (ROTFM). ROTFM is formulated in a baseline subtraction (BS) setting, and it is shown to achieve higher defect SNRs compared to TFM results obtained by directly applying the BS method to measured array data. More importantly, the performance of the proposed ROTFM is robust to time and spatial misalignments, and hence, it alleviates the need for complex compensation schemes when performing imaging computations. Compared to conventional TFM, ROTFM achieved an average SNR improvement of 3.41 dB and 6.05 dB in experiments for four test defects (cracks and holes of sizes 0.5 mm and 1 mm) at the frequencies of 5 MHz and 7 MHz, respectively.","2023-12-01","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","102943","","","140","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Defect detection; Imaging algorithms; Polycrystalline materials; TFM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Propagating cracks in plate structures for two types of loading – tensile and shear are considered. For both loading cases, at six different times after the start of the loading the analysis is carried out to investigate how the results vary for these six different stages of crack propagation. An ultrasonic excitation is applied at a point on the surface of the plate to generate guided waves propagating through the plate structure and interacting with generated cracks at different stages of crack formation. The out-of-plane velocity fields are recorded at the receiving material point for further analysis. A relatively new and promising nonlinear ultrasonic (NLU) technique called sideband peak count-index (or SPC-I) is adopted to extract the nonlinear response due to the generated cracks. Results show that when the crack propagation is at its early stage the SPC-I value first increases, and then decreases with time at the advanced stages of crack propagation. This is because for both types of loading (tensile or shear) the newly generated cracks are small cracks (or micro-cracks) in the beginning and then they evolve into macro-cracks under increasing loadings. The observation for SPC-I trends is consistent with other numerical modelings and experimental observations reported in the literature, and such qualitative matching gives confidence in the proposed method. The proposed method combining the peri‑ultrasound modeling and SPC-I technique presented in this paper can provide a new insight for monitoring crack propagation and give some guidance for experimental structural health monitoring (SHM) applications.","2024-01-06","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","117962","","","568","","Journal of Sound and Vibration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3-D plate structures; Crack propagation monitoring; Nonlinear ultrasonic technique; Ordinary state-based peridynamics; Peri-ultrasound modeling; SPC-I technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an elaborate experimental study to effectively monitor chloride-induced corrosion damage in reinforced concrete beams. A combined method of acoustic emission sensing and vibration-based monitoring is developed to detect, characterise and localise damage. Additionally, crack measurements on the concrete surface are performed as a reference technique. Four beams are corroded with an accelerated corrosion set-up while two additional beams are used as reference specimens. Whereas these monitoring techniques have already been applied individually to assess corrosion in reinforced concrete beams, they are here combined, in order to verify their complementarity. This results in an elaborate and innovative data-set which allows us to draw new conclusions on the way the techniques provide information on the evolution of corrosion damage in time and space. It was found that acoustic emission sensing can accurately detect and localise damage before cracking of the concrete, especially after dedicated noise filtering through clustering of the AE signals. Vibration-based monitoring is less sensitive to early damage, yet natural frequencies contain absolute information about the stiffness decrease due to corrosion damage, and strain mode shapes can localise damage on a larger scale. In addition, results from both techniques are in line with the crack measurements.

It is important to detect corrosion at its early stage to prevent further deterioration and catastrophic failures of the structures. Guided wave-based damage detection technique is one of the promising techniques for detecting and characterizing damage in structures. In water-immersed plate structures, most of the guided wave modes have strong attenuation due to energy leakage into the surrounding liquid. However, there is an interface wave mode known as quasi-Scholte waves, which can propagate with low attenuation. Therefore, this mode is promising for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. This paper presents an analysis of the capability of quasi-Scholte waves in detecting internal corrosion-like defects in water-immersed structures. A three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model is developed to simulate quasi-Scholte wave propagation and wave scattering phenomena on a steel plate with one side exposed to water. The accuracy of the model is validated through experimental measurements. There is good agreement between the FE simulations and experimental measurements. The experimentally verified 3D FE model is then employed in a series of parametric studies to analyze the scattering characteristics of quasi-Scholte waves at circular blind holes with different diameters and depths, which are the simplest representation of progressive corrosion. The findings of this study can enhance the understanding of quasi-Scholte waves scattering at corrosion damage of structures submerged in water and help improve the performance of in-situ damage detection techniques.","2021-01-01","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","102379","","","117","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Corrosion; Guided waves; Metallic plate; Quasi-scholte waves; Scattering; Submerged structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The damage is identified at the initial stage, so the cost associated with its repair can be reduced. Considering the immense scale of civil infrastructure, currently, available structural health monitoring systems are not feasible for mass application as they are prohibitively expensive. Hence, it is the need of the hour to develop a remote real-time Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS).

Accordingly, a comprehensive study of the effects of matrix cracks – e.g. their size and crack density – and the influence of different damage types and their interaction on the vibro-acoustic modulation (VAM) behaviour of CFRP specimens under fatigue loading was carried out. These effects were evaluated in two sets of commonly employed laminate layups. Firstly, in a cross-ply (CP) layup, the number of 90°layers was varied, with a constant areal weight (268g/m2). Secondly, quasi-isotropic (QI) specimens were tested, where the areal weight was reduced from thick-ply to thin-ply (30–268 g/m2), changing the failure mode from a delamination-dominated to a brittle failure. After damage introduction under tension–tension loading (R=0.1), high-frequency Lamb waves are introduced via piezoceramic actuators and modulated by a low-frequency vibration using a servo-hydraulic testing machine. VAM correlates with the different damage behaviour and damage conditions in CFRP. For this purpose, the evolution of the sideband amplitudes, the modulation index, the signal in time domain and X-ray scans are used. Regardless of the layup, the degree of stiffness-reducing inter-fibre fractures and large-scale delaminations can be detected.","2023-03-15","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","116696","","","308","","Composite Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Carbon fibre; Composite laminates; Damage progression; Health monitoring; Non-destructive testing; SHM; Thin-ply; Vibro-acoustic modulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An embedded sensor for use in concrete monitoring is developed using Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT). The electrical impedance (EI) response of the sensor placed inside concrete cubes of varying sizes are recorded for an applied electrical input of varying frequency. The dynamic response of the embedded PZT sensor to the applied electrical input is determined by the mechanical impedance offered by the surrounding medium. In specimens of finite size, the mechanical impedance to the motion of the PZT is influenced by the combination of dynamic material resistance and structural stiffness (size of the structure). The current study examined the effects of material resistance and size of structure on the EI response of the PZT sensor embedded in concrete medium. The influence of the size of the medium from small-sized specimens is seen in the form of secondary peaks, identified as structural peaks, on the resonance spectrum of the embedded PZT sensor. The structural peaks on the EI response are very dominant in the concrete cube of small sizes. Magnitude and intensity of these structural peaks attenuate with an increase in the size of the concrete cube. Also, the EI response from the smaller-sized specimens registered a significant leftward shift in the spectrum. The observations from the numerical simulations also showed the mechanical impedance of the surrounding concrete medium to the motion of the PZT also increases and converges at 150 mm. At sizes below 150 mm, the structural effects that are influenced by the specimen boundary must be separated to access the material properties of the concrete medium from the measured EI response of an embedded PZT sensor. At sizes, larger than 150 mm, the dynamic motion of the PZT patch and the measured EI response of the PZT patch depend only on the dynamic material properties of the concrete medium around the sensor. The zone of influence and its importance in standardization of PZT sensor for SHM of concrete structures is discussed.","2023-10-16","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","114575","","","361","","Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Concrete sensor; Electrical Impedance; Embedded; Mechanical impedance; PZT; Zone of influence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The output of the autoencoder contains artefact information (originating from structural features) and is projected back to the original domain.

To realize the complete process of SHM, research on GWs has concentrated on diagnosis and localization. GWs-based damage detection technology is widely used in plate structure, combining different sensor placement algorithms and equipment such as scanning laser doppler vibrometry (SLDV) to achieve accurate damage location. Simultaneously, developing the finite element method (FEM) allows for precise simulation in discontinuous media and complex sharp structures. Therefore, this paper combines the theoretical calculation approach of elastic wave propagation with the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, using the excitation signal and signal reflected by damage as the input matrix and target matrix, respectively. Thus, the reflection-waves coefficient matrix (RCM) containing damage information could be obtained after calculation by the OMP algorithm.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with non-destructive assessments based on output-only vibration signals represent the frontier of SHM. The present research study has handled an AI-based multi-class damage classification task on a numerical benchmark beam problem with three different procedures. The main purpose was to investigate the noise effects of the analyzed damage detection procedures simulating real-world accelerometer sensors. The first damage identification method leverages simple statistical features of vibration signals, whereas the second method additionally considers a subspace-based damage indicator. The third method relies on a dataset composed of a specific set of damage indicators. Two deep learning (DL) techniques have been adopted to compare and verify the results, i.e. a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a one-dimensional convolutional network (1D-CNN). Three groups of different reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels were set up to simulate micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer sensors in real-world conditions to evaluate noise effects. In a nutshell, the results demonstrated that the DL models based on stochastic subspace identification (SSI) methods have good noise immunity performance for damage detection purposes.","2023-08-01","2024-02-21 14:20:29","2024-02-21 14:20:29","","23-37","","","54","","Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Convolutional neural network; Multi-layer perceptron; Signal-to-noise ratio; Structural health monitoring; Subspace-based damage indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the DAS-SR method for composite structures, the group velocity of the travelling wave for different directions was first measured experimentally via PZTs. The DAS and SR formulations were then modified to be compatible with the direction-dependent group velocities. The results show that this modification increases the accuracy of the DAS and SR methods for damage location in a composite plate. However, using group-velocity instead of phase-velocity in the standard SR method, causes some model mismatch and errors in the damage localization and this problem was solved by using the modified hybrid DAS-SR method.

Experiments were carried out on laboratory specimens, which consists of carbon/epoxy laminates having three different stacking sequences ([0/0]s, [0/90]s, and [45/0–45/90]s) subjected to three different impact energies (7 J, 14 J, and 24 J) using conical shape impactor.

The ultrasonic C-scanning works on the principle of ultrasonic reflection at the interface of impedance mismatch.

Moreover, the electrical resistance increases with displacement in both Single Lap Shear (SLS) and Mode-I joints, due to the combined effect of adhesive deformation and crack propagation. More specifically, Mode-I joints usually show a stick–slip behaviour with sharp increases and arrest phases in the electrical resistance, associated to changes in the failure modes. Furthermore, a structural health monitoring (SHM) test of a composite repair was carried out by different techniques such as acoustic emission, strain gauges and CNT adhesive monitoring. From electrical monitoring of the CNT adhesive, it is possible to identify some load thresholds from which the electrical resistance starts to increase.

Numerical simulations were initially conducted to investigate the effects of factors such as the size effect, flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, combination scheme of the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, and heating power on the cooling law of the heat source, to further determined an optimized monitoring scheme. A series of model tests was then conducted based on this optimized scheme. First, the relationship between cooling discrimination index and axial flow velocity was calibrated. Then, by adjusting the water pressure, the leakage rates under different crack widths could be obtained, allowing for the derivation of a fitting formula to estimate the crack width using the water pressure and leakage rate.

To this end, artificial thermal images are generated through 3D numerical thermal analysis of an inherent fatigue damage heat source within a glass/epoxy composite, derived from sampling a multivariate Gaussian distribution of microcracks. Subsequently, these synthetic thermal images are employed to train three distinct regression models: a convolutional neural network, a Gaussian processes regressor, and a straightforward least squares model. Various image augmentation techniques are applied to expand the dataset efficiently. All models accurately predict the size of the damage and – most importantly – the maximum temperature within the damage deep inside the composite. The regression methods estimate the diagonal elements of covariance matrix components of the Gaussian distribution, with accuracies ranging from 86% to 99%.

This paper reviews the history of the field, covering the topics that must be addressed in the design of a test procedure, as well as applications in both NDT and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). The use of guided waves in long range NDT is relatively mature, and largely limited to simple structures in applications that are difficult or impossible to address by conventional point inspection methods. Point methods are impractical in most large area SHM applications where it is necessary to detect isolated defects since it is not possible to cover the whole area of interest with transducers. Guided waves therefore have great potential in SHM as they enable a large area of structure to be monitored from a limited number of transduction locations, so reducing the added weight, cost and complexity of the attachment to the structure. It is also possible to improve the sensitivity of the test relative to that obtained in one-off inspection by monitoring the change in signals with time using baseline subtraction. Current SHM deployments are largely in the same types of structure as those where guided wave NDT is used, but there is substantial potential for increasing the range of applications. The paper concludes with a review of the research and development needs for this potential to be realised.","2024-03-01","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","103026","","","142","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four point load tests were carried out on a 68 m long, Douglas fir timber truss instrumented with conventional electric strain gauges, distributed fibre optic sensors, and string potentiometers, among other instruments. These instruments makeup a larger, long-term structural health monitoring program implemented within the truss structure. The objectives of the local point load tests were to (1) confirm the in-situ monitoring instruments are in working order, (2) compare calculated mechanical properties with assumed properties, and (3) calibrate a numerical model capable of replicating truss response and compare to current modeling standards used within the Department of National Defence. Non-destructive testing, including moisture content and cable tension tests, was also conducted to determine existing material properties. Load testing and non-destructive testing results identified variations between the existing properties of the truss and the assumed properties of certain structural members, as well as identifying possible lower strength or stiffness values of stress-reversed members. Results also indicated the importance of analyzing timber as an orthotropic, bimodular material for reliability and conservatism, particularly in numerical modeling. Lastly, the results presented in this paper outline the importance of in-situ load testing with an aim to determine existing material properties for monitoring projects. Moreover, the identification of the existing properties and behaviour of the structure is fundamental in the development of a structural health monitoring program for emergency purposes.","2021-07-15","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","112274","","","239","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Heritage structures; Load testing; Material properties; Orthotropic material; Stress/Reversal; Structural health monitoring; Timber; Warren truss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, monitoring the evolution of debris-filled damage in structure is studied using pre-modulated wave and guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT). The structural responses in the varying percentage of debris-filled damage were processed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Hilbert Transform (HT) and correlation techniques. The regression analysis of debris-filled damage resulted in empirical predictive models that could detect the damage and percentage of debris that might have filled it with average percentage errors of 1.34 and 0.21, respectively. The debris in the damage caused an overmodulation of the high-frequency signal. The intensity of the lower sideband (LSB) was observed to be very sensitive to variations in the damage than the upper sideband (USB).

It requires the evaluation of Green's function solutions and its rigorous differentiation for complex geometry problems having a large set of distributed point sources. DPSM is much faster than the finite element method (FEM) however, it is analytically demanding as it requires differentiation of the Green's function. The intricacy associated with differentiation operation hinders the potential application of DPSM in large-scale automation and real-time structural health monitoring. The current paper introduces machine-learning-based strategies within DPSM and yields the proposed Neural Green-DPSM (NG-DPSM) framework. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is incorporated in the DPSM framework for evaluating the Green's function and its gradients. To train the PINN, displacement Green's function solutions of wave propagation in isotropic solid is used as the governing physics. Once the PINN is trained for displacement Green's function solutions, the NG-DPSM framework leverages the trained network and its automatic differentiation capability to predict displacement and stress fields annihilating the rigorous differentiation of Green's functions. The accuracy and efficacy of NG-DPSM are demonstrated using two numerical experiments. First, the ultrasonic fields are evaluated for the problem geometry of a plate immersed in fluid excited at different angles of incidence. Further, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated for wave scattering through a circular hole in the plate.

In this paper, a method for analyzing the guided wave propagation characteristics of the turnout straight switch rail with variable cross-section is proposed, and the effectiveness of the method verified by finite element simulation and field experiments. The results show that the dispersion characteristics of the turnout straight switch rail change slowly along the longitudinal direction, and that at a local level the dispersion characteristics are in fact similar to rails of constant cross-section. Based on this, a three-dimensional dispersion surface with cross-sectional position information is proposed, after which the variation regularity of dispersion characteristics along the longitudinal direction is analyzed in combination with the mode shapes of the cross section at different positions.

As a destructive phenomenon, the need to detect the onset of ASR in concrete structures to ensure their long-term durability and structural integrity is thus evidenced. In the structural health monitoring field, vision-based approaches have been found to be viable, fast, and cost-effective in diagnosing numerous types of cracks using physical attributes and surface patterns. However, achieving high accuracy in detecting ASR cracks using traditional visual inspection techniques is challenging and time-consuming. Inspired by artificial intelligence technology, this paper proposes and evaluates a two-phase computer vision procedure for detecting and classifying ASR cracks utilizing a collection of ASR images recorded from several bridges in Queensland, Australia. In the first phase, the procedure compares common pre-trained CNN models to investigate their capability in classifying ASR cracks and to select the best-performed model. In the second phase, a novel Feature Enhancement Process (FEP) was first proposed to increase the contrast between ASR cracks and the heavily textured backgrounds within the images. Next, to better highlight the ASR crack features, the feature-adjusted images are processed further through different texture analysis algorithms including: (i) Texture Morphology, (ii) Adaptive thresholding, and (iii) Local range filtering. The study shows that the proposed FEP can improve the ASR crack classification accuracy of InceptionV3, which is the best CNN model selected from Phase 1, from 90.9% to 92.48%. Furthermore, by combining FEP with texture morphology, a robust two-stage tool for assessing ASR cracks can be made with an impressive validation accuracy of 94.07%. This research contributes towards the application of novel AI deep learning technology in providing cost-effective autonomous ASR crack classification tools to support the owners and managers of civil public works assets and other constructed infrastructures.","2023-04-01","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","494-507","","","50","","Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alkali-Silica Reaction; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Feature Enhancement; Structural Health Monitoring; Texture Analysis; Two-stage Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main research works and contributions of this research are given as follows: The development of the penetration resistance was acquired by measuring the Vicat needle penetration depth. Meanwhile, the EMI spectra within two scanning frequency ranges, 1000 kHz and 3000 kHz, were continuously captured. The key innovation of this research is that a DL-based framework named EMI-integrated neural network (EMI-IntNet) was proposed, which could facilitate the achievement of intelligent monitoring and assessment. The EMI-IntNet, which combines a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) and an attention mechanism, can accurately predict the dynamic penetration impedance from raw EMI data without any pre-processing or subjective judgment. Two datasets collected in two separate vibration modes (d31 and d33) were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the EMI-IntNet can quantitatively evaluate the dynamic penetration impedance of cement mortar with an error of less than 2 % and a coefficient of determination (R2) value over 0.99 for both datasets. The EMI-IntNet’s forecasting accuracy, noise immunity and adaptability were thoroughly investigated, which outperform that of the machine learning-based approaches, 1D-CNN and 1D-CNN-LSTM. In conclusion, the proposed method enables automatic data acquisition, feature extraction and identification of EMI signals, contributing to the intelligent monitoring and accurate assessment of the mechanical impedance change throughout the early-age hydration and setting of cement mortar.","2022-11-15","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","111984","","","203","","Measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cement mortar; Deep learning; Early-age hydration; Electromechanical impedance (EMI); PZT sensor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It reduces structural stiffness and changes in dynamic responses, which can be successfully used for assessing structural health monitoring (SHM) of composite structures. SHM often requires the solution of an inverse problem. This study focuses on solving the inverse problem with minimal computational time to predict delamination size, in-plane location, and interface. For the inverse model, two computational intelligence algorithms, the surrogate-assisted real-coded genetic algorithm (SARGA) and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used. A surrogate model is a fast-executing model for predicting the shift in the natural frequency using a forward ANN. For ANN training, the database size was optimized. The layerwise theory was solved using the finite element method for a laminated tapered FRP plate with ply drop-off, and ‘constrained mode’ is used to model the delamination. The experimental modal analysis was conducted on a glass-fibre reinforced polymer tapered composite plate with one intact plate and three artificially delaminated plates. The algorithms are validated using numerically simulated and experimentally measured frequencies. The numerical validation showed a better prediction of delamination size, in-plane location, and interface when compared with the experimental validation. Nevertheless, SARGA can reasonably predict the size, in-plane (x) location and interface of the delamination with an average overlapping ratio of 72.89%. The comparison of algorithms demonstrates the application of SARGA with the frequency-based approach for delamination detection and real-time condition monitoring in real-world applications.","2022-11-01","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","116054","","","299","","Composite Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural network; Delamination; Genetic algorithm; Natural frequency; Ply drop-off; Surrogate model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a 2D phased array is used to experimentally image artificial defects (represented by bottom-drilled holes and electrical discharge machined notches) within a test specimen with a doubly-curved surface profile in an immersion configuration. The array is mechanically scanned above the entire surface of the specimen and the 3-dimensional (3D), or volumetric, images generated at each position are combined to produce a single image of the specimen's entire surface. The surface profile is then extracted and discretised for interior volumetric imaging. The results show that the root mean square (RMS) error between the ultrasonically extracted surface and the true surface is 0.04 mm and 95% of absolute errors are less than 0.07 mm. Finally, the positions of visible defects are measured, using (i) the depth above the back wall and (ii) the lateral distance from a notch on the specimen's surface, and compared to their true values.

Hence, there is a lot of active research in the area for SHM of civil and mechanical structures. The SHM system should be low cost, suitable for continuous monitoring, able to detect small levels of damage. Guided waves (GW) based SHM techniques allow monitoring of large thin-walled structures with a few sensors and have been identified as the most promising of techniques for SHM. The GW based techniques allow mapping of damage very easily, and hence are a powerful tool for assessing the damage. The mapping of damage with high resolution is of course computationally expensive and hinders real-time decision making. Hence, methods are being developed to minimize the processing time. In this paper, the authors implement a sequential niching particle swarm optimization (PSO) for multiple damage detection. It is shown that the niching PSO is able to detect multiple damage scenarios effectively. The processing time is significantly better (order of magnitude) hence making it suitable for real-time assessment.

Second harmonic Lamb waves, which result from the interaction of fundamental waves with material microstructural defects, have great potential for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications. However, understanding of the second harmonic generation in composite laminates remains largely insufficient, which hinders practical SHM applications. This issue is investigated in this study to highlight the quasi-cumulative second harmonic B2 mode Lamb wave in the low frequency range. Theoretical analyses are conducted to ascertain how anisotropy affects the quasi-cumulative effect, followed and validated by numerical simulations and analyses considering different wave propagation angles. The characteristics of the second harmonic B2 mode Lamb waves are further explored in terms of the cumulative feature, robustness to wave beam divergence, and excitability. Experiments are finally carried out to monitor material degradation during the thermal aging of a carbon fiber reinforced panel. The results confirm the omnidirectional cumulative effect of quasi-phase-matched second harmonic B2 mode Lamb waves. It is revealed that the 0° propagating Lamb waves exhibit superior cumulative effect, high robustness to wave beam divergence, and good excitability, rendering them an ideal tool for SHM applications. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of the second harmonic B2 mode waves to material degradation is demonstrated, confirming their promise for material degradation monitoring applications in composite structures.","2024-04-01","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","103064","","","143","","NDT & E International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Composite laminates; Lamb waves; Material degradation; Second harmonics; Structural health monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real-time monitoring of the compressive strength development during the concrete curing process can effectively guide the staged construction and ensure the safety and stability of engineering structures. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to monitor and evaluate the early-age concrete strength development by integrating PZT-enabled active sensing and deep learning (DL) techniques. First of all, the stress wave signals were continuously captured during the concrete curing process using PZT-enabled active sensing, and then the time-frequency diagrams were generated from the collected signals through the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). After that, an innovative DL-based framework named concrete early-age strength monitoring network (CESMonitorNet) was developed to automatically learn optimal features from the CWT spectrum and ultimately quantify the early-age concrete strength. Finally, experiments on laboratory-cast concrete specimens were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comprehensive comparison analysis with the widely used machine learning-based methods and convolutional neural network (CNN) was also performed. The results show that the proposed method can accurately predict the concrete strength development and has superior performances over other methods, indicating its great potential for real-time monitoring and rapid evaluation of the strength development of early-age concrete.","2023-04-01","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","112657","","","211","","Measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Active sensing; Concrete material; Deep learning; Early-age strength; PZT transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basis for damage detection is the difference between healthy and damaged structural responses to different ground accelerations. In doing so, two Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) scales, 0.05 (g), and 0.5 (g), labeled for the Loma Prieta ground motion, are considered. Four-node meshes are applied to reflect the torsion moments in the steel plate behavior. A multi-objective function, Fisher Information Matrix, is utilized, and four sensor locations are optimized to identify the locations most sensitive to damage. AutoRegressive Moving Average with exogenous input (ARMAX) system identification method is employed to obtain the structural displacement from the acceleration data and, subsequently, the displacement state equations of the nodes. With the aid of the structural displacement and its derivatives obtained through the central finite difference approximation method, damage to the plate structure is detected at PGA = 0.05 (g) and PGA = 0.50 (g) considering thickness changes based on the peak values manifested in the proposed damage detection index. Furthermore, the recorded structural acceleration responses at the desired scales of PGAs are fed into the 2D wavelet transform to detect damage imposed on the plate structure using the diagonal component of the wavelet transform. The results confirm that the proposed nonmodel-based approach successfully detects the single and multiple damage scenarios and can be used for a quick and judicious assessment of the steel plate behavior immediately after damage.","2023-10-01","2024-02-21 14:20:30","2024-02-21 14:20:30","","104989","","","56","","Structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Acceleration response; ARMAX system identification method; Bending and torsion moments; Damage index; Displacement response and its derivatives; Optimal sensor placement; Steel plate structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental results show that the MXene/CNT film sensor embedded in the composite laminates can effectively capture the change of the resin phase, that characterized by resistance. MXene/CNT films have a good ability to respond to changes in the resin state. The gel point of resin obtained from the MXene/CNT film sensor is 134 °C, which is consistent with 137 °C from the DMA results.

The challenge is no longer to estimate the true concrete strength, but to limit the risk of a wrong estimation within a certain admissible interval. In this context, it is shown how synthetic simulations are used to capture the main features of this problem and are a firm basis for justifying the relationship between the most influencing parameters and the quality of the assessment.

Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are three widely-used methods for BTS prediction. This study investigated the performance of these three intelligent models for BTS forecasting. In this regard, three non-destructive tests, namely Schmidt hammer, p-wave velocity, and density, were performed on 127 granitic rock samples, and their results were considered as input parameters. Then, the BTS tests were carried out on the samples and their results were considered as model output. Four measures of coefficient of determination (R2), Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), and Scatter index (SI) were used for evaluation. The results showed that the ANFIS model, which is enjoying advantages of both ANN and FIS models, provides more accurate results in comparison with the proposed ANN and FIS models in predicting BTS values. R2 values for ANFIS, ANN, and FIS models were 0.92, 0.88, and 0.87, respectively. Besides, the ANFIS model could yield the lowest RMSE value of 81.5%, whereas RMSEs for FIS and ANN were 89.5% and 87.5%, respectively.","2021-11-01","2024-02-21 15:47:18","2024-02-21 15:47:18","2024-02-21 15:47:18","100652","","","31","","Transportation Geotechnics","Tensile strength prediction of rock material using non-destructive tests","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\5PXJN9WN\S2214391221001422.html","","","Artificial intelligence techniques; Indirect prediction; Non-destructive rock index test; Rock tensile strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, using destructive tests, such as taking cores from the concrete, can be costly and dangerous; specifically for damaged structures. Therefore, it is preferred to use in-situ non-destructive testing (NDT) in the assessment of damaged concrete. The objective of this study is to develop an artificial neural network model, based on destructive and non-destructive testing results, to assess the concrete strength after being subjected to high-temperature levels; without the need for further in-situ destructive testing. The effect of high-temperature levels (200–800 °C) on concrete compressive strength was investigated in this study using destructive compression and non-destructive tests on concrete cubes; including ultrasonic pulse velocity and Schmidt rebound hammer testing methods. The results of destructive and non-destructive tests of damaged and undamaged concrete were found to be highly correlated. Therefore, the data of this study and data obtained from the cited literature were augmented together and used to optimise and train the artificial neural network model. The artificial neural network analysis indicated that concrete compressive strength (CS), the magnitude of high-temperature damage, and the level of exposure temperature can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using only a combination of non-destructive tests results. The model had a coefficient of determination equals to 0.944.","2022-06-01","2024-02-21 15:47:36","2024-02-21 15:47:36","2024-02-21 15:47:36","e01080","","","16","","Case Studies in Construction Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\JI8KJX9S\S2214509522002121.html","","","Artificial neural network; Compressive strength; Concrete; Damage; Fire; High temperature; Non-destructive test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Piers were aged by using an imposed electric current and sodium chloride water solution before performing a mechanical cyclic-load test. The corrosion process has been detected with Non-Destructive Evaluation techniques by means of SonReb method (to check concrete degradation) and by measuring corrosion potential (to check steel degradation). The crack pattern was recorded by dedicated cameras, and an LVDT system was set up to monitor the cyclic-load test. Experimental results focused on degradation monitoring and mechanical performance under cyclic loads. During the cyclic-load mechanical test, the first cracks on the piers surface occurred diagonally, inclined at about 45°. This is the consequence of the failure mode change from ductile failure, as expected for slender designed piers, to brittle shear failure. The flexural failure occurred in the case of non-corroded piers. Presented tests can provide a useful contribution of experimental data to analyse the behaviour of corroded reinforced concrete hollow bridge piers, scarcely tested. In particular, the cyclic response can be a useful reference for the proposition/validation of nonlinear capacity models for the evaluation of the seismic capacity of corroded bridge piers.","2023-03-31","2024-02-21 15:48:52","2024-02-21 15:48:52","","2790","","7","16","","Materials (Basel)","Reinforcement Corrosion in RC Hollow Piers","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37049086 PMCID: PMC10095726","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\7BPH56TJ\Lignola et al. - 2023 - Reinforcement Corrosion in RC Hollow Piers Destru.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37049086","","corrosion; experimental test; hollow bridge piers; monitoring; structural safety; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water sewer networks and distribution systems have a definite service life span to provide continuous facilities to end users. Therefore, it is pertinent to continuously evaluate the condition of water and sewer concrete pipelines to ensure the reliable, sustainable, and cost-efficient transport of water and sewerage for the safety of society. The condition assessment is commonly carried out by visual observations followed by some non-destructive testing methods. However, it is the need of the hour to shift assessment methods to advance assessment techniques to save time and money for our community. Currently, in this project, the condition assessment of pre-cast concrete pipes was carried out by destructive and non-destructive methods. Different test trials i.e., ultra-sonic pulse velocity, Schmidt hammer also known as rebound hammer test, visual inspection, three edge bearing test, and core cutting test on the old buried and new concrete pipes were performed. It was observed that concrete used for the construction of existing precast concrete pipes still has better quality indices after 20 years as compared to that of concrete of new pipes. However, steel has deteriorated with time and clear corrosion of steel was identified in existing pre-cast concrete pipes. At the same time, it was observed that there should be an automated mechanism to continuously asses the condition of pre-cast existing pipes which will address the sustainable development goals (SDG 6, 9, 11). Consequently, it can be said that condition assessment of pre-cast concrete pipes will lead to sustainable societies and infrastructure.","2023-05","2024-02-21 15:49:00","2024-02-21 15:49:00","","e15471","","5","9","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37153396 PMCID: PMC10160362","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\HQ87UFF2\Abbass et al. - 2023 - Predicting the performance of existing pre-cast co.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37153396","","Condition assessment; Destructive test; Non-destructive test (NDT); Precast concrete pipe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondly, it is to compare the performance of the measurement system with the tensile test. The performance of the NDT prototype will be put to test by using different type of specimens such as aluminium alloy, copper, brass, and carbon steel. Each type of specimen will carry be tested three times to get the average of the data. After all the data collection of the NDT measurement system, the tensile test will be carried out. A comparison for the measurement of the elastic modulus will be conducted between the NDT system, tensile test, and theoretical results.

However, there is a lack of studies to analyze the synergistic effect of jute fiber and fly ash on the properties of concrete. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the combined effect of fly ash concentration and the different sizes of jute fiber on the fresh, hardened, and non-destructive testing properties of concrete. Concerning the purpose, the concrete mixes were prepared with 0.2 % and 0.4 % jute fiber incorporating 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % replacement of cement by fly ash in concrete. For the assessment of properties, slump, density, and compacting factor test was conducted at the fresh state of concrete, whereas mechanical properties such as compressive, splitting tensile, and flexure strength test were conducted at 7 and 28 days. In addition, the non-destructive test (NDT) was also carried out to predict the destructive compressive strength by rebound hammer at 28 days. The microstructure property of optimum mix concrete was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is observed that the incorporation of jute fiber decreased the slump, density, and compacting factor but increased the compressive, splitting tensile, and flexure strength, whereas the fly ash improved both fresh and hardened properties. Compared to the standard mix, fly ash-based JFRC mixtures have compressive strength improvements varying from 1.7 % to 25.9 %. The 10 % fly ash and 0.2 % volume of jute fiber exhibited a maximum of 11.64 % and 10.72 % splitting tensile and flexural strength enhancement at 28 days, respecting the control mix. In addition, the NDT strength assessment obtained 5.5 % less than destructive strength on average. From the SEM point of view, it is obtained that the 10 % fly ash with 0.2 % jute fiber composition matrix exhibits a better bonding interface and the cracking resistance nature of the concrete mix.","2023-11","2024-02-21 15:49:27","2024-02-21 15:49:27","","e21708","","11","9","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38027873 PMCID: PMC10643492","","C:\Users\vince\Zotero\storage\QSRTZVCL\Hossain et al. - 2023 - Exploring the synergistic effect of fly ash and ju.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38027873","","Fly ash; Fresh properties; Jute fiber; Mechanical properties; Non-destructive testing; Sustainable concrete","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
