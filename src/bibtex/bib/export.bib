   abstract = {<p>In a highly competitive and demanding microelectronics market, non-destructive testing (NDT) technology has been widely applied to defect detection and evaluation of microelectronic packaging. However, the trend of microelectronic packaging toward miniaturization, high-density, ultra-thin, ultra-light and with small chip footprint, poses an urgent demand for novel NDT methods with high-resolution and large penetration depth, which is utilized for internal defect detection and identification of advanced complicated packages. The conventional NDT methods for microelectronic packaging mainly include optical visual inspection, X-ray inspection, active infrared thermography, scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser Doppler vibration measuring technique, scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and so on. This paper aims to provide a review of addressing their basic principles, advantages, limitations and application researches in the field of defect inspection of microelectronic packaging. Moreover, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing NDT methods, this paper emphasizes a novel NDT approach, called hybrid ultrasonic-laser digital holographic microscopy (DHM) imaging inspection method, and discusses its basic principle, merits, key techniques, system construction and experimental results in detail. When some key technical problems can be solved in further research, this method will become a potentially promising technique for defect detection and evaluation of advanced complicated packages.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Silicone rubber insulators (SRIs) are widely used in high-voltage power grids. Due to high-voltage fields and harsh environmental conditions, SRIs eventually deteriorate with use in the power grid, decreasing their insulating performance and operational life and contributing to transmission line failures. Therefore, quantitatively assessing the aging status of SRIs is crucial. In this study, we evaluated the viability of the magnetic resonance method for assessing the age of SRIs at the level of chemical structure; we built and made a portable magnetic resonance sensor, and evaluated the sensorâ€™s functionality. By measuring the SRI sheds at various service times, it was discovered that the equivalent transverse relaxation time, T2eff, can describe the degree of aging of the SRIs. The results of the magnetic resonance measurements were also compared with those of the static contact angle method, and the two measurement methods yielded the same conclusions. However, the magnetic resonance method was more sensitive than the one using the static contact angle method.</p>},
